SOCIAL 9TH CLASS

HISTORY
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION

The French Revolution
In 1789, in the wake of early morning, the city of Paris was in a state of alarm. Rumours spread that the King would open fire upon the citizens. People started gathering, and they started breaking down a number of government buildings in search of arms. The commander of the Bastille was killed in the armed fight, and the prisoners were released. People hated the Bastille as it stood for the despotic power of the king. People protested against the high price of bread. A new chain of events began, which led to the execution of the King in France.

French Society During the Late Eighteenth Century
Louis XVI, in 1774, ascended the throne of France. Financial France was drained because of the war. France, under Louis XVI, helped the thirteen American colonies to gain their independence from Britain. Taxes were increased to meet regular expenses, such as the cost of maintaining an army, the court, and running government offices or universities. The country of France was divided into three estates in the eighteenth century. The feudal system was part of the society’s estates dating back to the middle ages. 90 percent of the population was dominated by peasants, but only a small number of them owned the land they cultivated. 60 percent was owned by nobles, the Church and other richer members of the third estate. The clergy and the nobility, members of the first two estates, enjoyed certain privileges by birth. These groups of members were exempted from paying taxes and enjoyed feudal privileges. All members of the third estate had to pay taxes to the state, which included a direct tax, called taille, and a number of indirect taxes, which were levied on articles of everyday consumption like salt or tobacco.

The Struggle to Survive
The increase in population led to a rapid increase in the requirement for food grains. Production of grains could not keep pace with the demand, due to which the price of bread rose rapidly. Due to the low wages paid to the labourers, the gap between the poor and the rich widened. Things became worse whenever drought or hail reduced the harvest.

A Growing Middle Class Envisages an End to Privileges
Peasants used to participate in revolts against taxes and food scarcity. The group of the third estate had become prosperous and had access to education and new ideas. In the eighteenth century, new social groups emerged, termed the middle class, who earned their wealth through expanding overseas trade and by manufacturing woollen and silk textiles that were either exported or bought by the richer members of society. The third estate included professions such as lawyers or administrative officials. A person’s social position was dependent on their merit.

All these groups were educated and believed that no group in society should be privileged by birth. Rather, a person’s social position must depend on his merit. A new form of government was proposed by Rousseau based on a social contract between people and their representatives.

Similarly, Montesquieu proposed a division of power within the government between the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. In the USA, this model of government was put into force. Louis Louis XVI planned to impose further taxes to meet the expenses.

The Outbreak of the Revolution
In France, the monarch didn’t have the power to impose taxes. They had to call a meeting of the Estates-General, a political body to which the three estates sent their representatives, to pass proposals for new taxes. Louis XVI, on 5 May 1789, called an assembly to pass proposals for new taxes. Representatives from the first and second estates were present, and the third estate was represented by its prosperous and educated members. According to the principle, each estate had one vote. But, representatives from the third estate demanded each member would have one vote. The demand was rejected, so members of the third estate walked out to protest. They swore not to disperse till a constitution was drafted for France that would limit the powers of the monarch.

Due to the severe winter, bread prices rose, and people had to spend hours in long queues. Rumours spread that the lords of the manor hired bands of brigands to destroy the ripe crops. In fear, peasants started looting hoarded grain and burnt down documents containing records of manorial dues. Nobles fled from their homes. Louis XVI accorded recognition to the National Assembly and accepted the principle that his powers would, from now on, be checked by a constitution. The Assembly passed a decree abolishing the feudal system of obligations and taxes on 4 August 1789. Tithes were abolished, and lands owned by the Church were confiscated.

France Becomes a Constitutional Monarchy
In 1791, The National Assembly completed the draft of the constitution, and its main object was to limit the powers of the monarch. These powers were now separated and assigned to different institutions – the legislature, executive and judiciary. France became a constitutional monarchy.

Citizens voted for a group of electors, who in turn chose the Assembly, but unfortunately, not every citizen had the right to vote. Men above 25 years of age who paid taxes equal to at least 3 days of a labourer’s wage were entitled to vote. The Constitution began with a Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. Rights such as the right to life, freedom of speech, freedom of opinion, and equality before the law were established as ‘natural and inalienable’ rights; that is, they belonged to each human being by birth and could not be taken away.

France Abolishes Monarchy and Becomes a Republic
In April 1792, the National Assembly voted for a war against Prussia and Austria. Marseillaise became the national anthem of France. While men were away fighting in the war, women took care of their families. Large sections of the population demanded that the revolution had to be carried further, as the Constitution of 1791 gave political rights only to the richer sections of society. Political clubs were formed, and among them, Jacobins became the most successful club. Members of the Jacobin club included small shopkeepers, artisans such as shoemakers, pastry cooks, watch-makers, printers, as well as servants and daily-wage workers. Jacobin members started wearing long striped trousers similar to those worn by dockworkers. These Jacobins were called the sans-culottes, literally meaning ‘those without knee breeches’. On August 10 1792, Jacobins stormed the Palace of the Tuileries and held the king hostage for several hours. Elections were held, and all men of 21 years and above got the right to vote. The monarchy was abolished on 21 September 1792, and France was declared a republic. Louis XVI was sentenced to death by a court on the charge of treason.

The Reign of Terror
The period from 1793 to 1794 is referred to as the Reign of Terror. People whom Robespierre saw as enemies of the republic were arrested, imprisoned and then tried by a revolutionary tribunal. If they were declared guilty by the court, then they were guillotined. The guillotine is a device consisting of two poles and a blade with which a person is beheaded, named after Dr Guillotin. Laws were issued to place a maximum ceiling on wages and prices. Meat and bread were rationed. Expensive white flour was forbidden to use. Equality was practised through forms of speech and address. All French men and women were addressed as Citoyen and Citoyenne (Citizen). In July 1794, he was convicted by a court, arrested and the next day sent to the guillotine.

A Directory Rules France
The fall of the Jacobin government allowed the wealthier middle classes to seize power. According to the new constitution, non-propertied sections of society were denied voting. It provided for two elected legislative councils. The government appointed a Directory consisting of executives made up of five members. Political instability paved the way for a military dictator, Napoleon Bonaparte.

Did Women have a Revolution?
Women were active participants from the beginning, which brought important changes in the country of France. Women from the third estate had to work for a living, and they didn’t have access to education or job training. Daughters of nobles of the third estate were allowed to study at a convent. Working women also had to care for their families. Compared to men, their wages were lower. Women also started their political clubs and newspapers. The Society of Revolutionary and Republican Women was one of the most famous women’s clubs. They demanded equal political rights as men, the right to vote and to hold political office. The revolutionary government introduced laws to improve the lives of women. Schooling became compulsory, divorce was made legal, and they could run small businesses. During the Reign of Terror, the government closed women’s clubs banning their political activities. After much struggle, women in France in 1946 won the right to vote.

The Abolition of Slavery
Jacobin’s regime’s most revolutionary social reform was the abolition of slavery in the French colonies. In the seventeenth century, the slavery trade began. Slaves were brought from local chieftains, branded and shackled and packed tightly into ships for the three-month-long voyage across the Atlantic to the Caribbean. Slave labour met the growing demand in European markets for sugar, coffee, and indigo. Throughout the eighteenth century, there was little criticism of slavery in France. In 1794, the Convention legislated to free all slaves in the French overseas possessions. Napoleon introduced slavery after ten years. In 1848, slavery was abolished in French colonies.

The Revolution and Everyday Life
France during 1789 saw changes in the lives of men, women and children. The abolition of censorship happened in the summer of 1789. Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed freedom of speech and expression to be a natural right. Freedom of the press meant opposing views of events could be expressed. Plays, songs and festive processions attracted large numbers of people.

Conclusion
Napoleon Bonaparte crowned himself Emperor of France in 1804 and introduced many laws, such as the protection of private property and a uniform system of weights and measures provided by the decimal system. Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo in 1815. The ideas of liberty and democratic rights were the most important legacy of the French Revolution. Colonised peoples reworked the idea of freedom to create a sovereign nation-state.

SOCIALISM IN EUROPE AND THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION

The Age of Social Change
After the revolution, individual rights and social power began to be discussed in many parts of the world, including Europe and Asia. Colonial development reshaped ideas of societal change, but everyone was not in favour of the complete transformation of society. Through the revolution in Russia, socialism became one of the most significant and powerful ideas to shape society in the twentieth century.

Liberals, Radicals and Conservatives
Liberals wanted a nation which tolerated all religions. They opposed the uncontrolled power of dynastic rules and argued for a representative, elected parliamentary government subject to laws interpreted by a well-trained judiciary that was independent of rulers and officials. They wanted a government based on the majority of a country’s population. Conservatives, after the nineteenth century, accepted changes but also believed the past needed to be respected and change should begin slowly.

Industrial Society and Social Change
Industrial Revolution led to changes in social and economic life, new cities came up, and new industrialised regions developed. Men, women and children came to factories in search of work. But, unfortunately, working hours were long, and wages were poor. There was unemployment during the time of low demand for industrial goods. Liberals and radicals made wealth through trade or industrial ventures. According to them, society can be developed if the freedom of individuals is ensured, if the poor can labour, and if those with capital can operate without restraint. In France, Italy, Germany and Russia, revolutionaries overthrow existing monarchs. Nationalists talked of revolutions to create ‘nations’ with equal rights.

The Coming of Socialism to Europe
Socialism was a well-known body of ideas by the mid-nineteenth century in Europe. Socialists were against private property and saw it as the root of all social ills of the time. They wanted to change it and campaigned for it. Robert Owen (1771-1858) sought to build a cooperative community called New Harmony in Indiana (USA). Louis Blanc (1813-1882) wanted the government to encourage cooperatives and replace capitalist enterprises. Karl Marx (1818-1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) added other ideas to this body of arguments. According to Marx, industrial society was ‘capitalist’ who owned the capital invested in factories, and the profit of capitalists was produced by workers. Capitalism and the rule of private property were overthrown. Marx believed that a communist society was the natural society of the future.

Support for Socialism
By the 1870s, socialist ideas spread through Europe, and they formed an international body – namely, the Second International. Associations were formed by workers in Germany and England to fight for better living and working conditions. The Labour Party and Socialist Party were formed by socialists and trade unionists by 1905.

The Russian Revolution
In the October Revolution of 1917, socialists took over the government in Russia. The fall of the monarchy in February 1917 and the events of October were termed the Russian Revolution.

The Russian Empire in 1914
In 1914, Russia was ruled by Tsar Nicholas II and its empire. The Russian Empire included current-day Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, parts of Poland, Ukraine and Belarus, stretching to the Pacific and comprised today’s Central Asian states, as well as Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The majority of the population was Russian Orthodox Christianity.

Economy and Society
At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Russian population was dominated by agriculturalists, who used to cultivate for the market as well as for their own needs. St Petersburg and Moscow were prominent industrial areas. Craftsmen undertook much of the production, but large factories existed alongside craft workshops. In the 1890s, more factories were set up, and foreign investment in industry increased. Large factories were supervised by the government to ensure minimum wages and limited hours of work. Workers were a divided social group. They were also divided by their skill. Despite divisions, workers united to stop work when they disagreed with employers about dismissals or work conditions.

Peasants cultivated most of the land, but the nobility, the crown and the Orthodox Church owned large properties. Nobles got power and position through their services to the Tsar. In Russia, peasants wanted the land of the nobles.

Socialism in Russia
Political parties in Russia were legal before 1914. In 1898, socialists founded the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party, which respected Marx’s ideas. Some Russian socialists felt that the Russian peasant custom of dividing land periodically made them natural socialists. Throughout the nineteenth century, socialists were active in the countryside and formed the Socialist Revolutionary Party in 1900. The party struggled for peasants’ rights and demanded land belonging to nobles be transferred to peasants. The party was divided over the strategy of the organisation. According to Vladimir Lenin, in a repressive society like Tsarist Russia, the party should be disciplined and should control the number and quality of its members. Mensheviks thought that the party should be open to all.

A Turbulent Time: The 1905 Revolution
Russia was an autocracy, and even at the beginning of the twentieth century, the Tsar was not subject to Parliament. During the Revolution of 1905, Russia, along with the Social Democrats and Socialist Revolutionaries, worked with peasants and workers to demand a constitution. For Russian workers, bad times started from the year 1904 as prices of essential goods rose and their real wages declined by 20 per cent. Workers went on strike demanding a reduction in the working day to eight hours, an increase in wages and an improvement in working conditions. The procession was attacked by the police and the Cossacks when it reached the Winter Palace. The incident, known as Bloody Sunday, started a series of events which resulted in the 1905 Revolution. During the 1905 Revolution, the Tsar allowed the creation of an elected consultative Parliament or Duma. After 1905, most committees and unions worked unofficially since they were declared illegal.

The First World War and the Russian Empire
In 1914, war broke out between two European alliances – Germany, Austria and Turkey (the Central powers) and France, Britain and Russia (later Italy and Romania). This was the First World War. The war became popular, and as it continued, the Tsar refused to consult the main parties in the Duma. Support wore thin. The First World War was different on the easter front and on the western front. Between 1914 and 1916 Russian army lost badly in Germany and Austria. Russian army destroyed crops and buildings to prevent the enemy from being able to live off the land. The country was cut off from other suppliers of industrial goods by German control of the Baltic Sea. Railway lines began to break down by 1916. For the people in the cities, bread and flour became scarce. By the winter of 1916, riots at bread shops were common.

The February Revolution in Petrograd
Petrograd City is divided among its people. On the right bank of the River Neva, workers’ quarters and factories were located and on the left bank located fashionable areas such as the Winter Palace and official buildings. Food shortages deeply affected the workers’ quarters. On the right bank, a factory was shut down on February 22. Women also led the way to strikes, and it is called International Women’s Day. The government imposed a curfew as the fashionable quarters and official buildings were surrounded by workers. Duma was suspended on 25th February. The streets thronged with demonstrators raising slogans about bread, wages, better hours and democracy. The government called out the cavalry, but they refused to fire on the demonstrators. Soldiers and striking workers gathered to form a ‘soviet’ or ‘council’ in the same building where the Duma met, and it is termed the Petrograd Soviet. Soviet leaders and Duma leaders formed a Provisional Government to run the country. Russia’s future would be decided by a constituent assembly elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage. Petrograd led the February Revolution which brought down the monarchy in February 1917.

After February
Under the Provisional Government, army officials, landowners and industrialists were influential. Liberals and socialists worked towards an elected government. Restrictions on public meetings and associations were removed. In April 1917, the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin returned to Russia from his exile. Lenin demanded three things termed as ‘April Theses’. He wanted war to end, land to be transferred to the peasants, and banks to be nationalised. He also emphasised renaming the Bolshevik Party to the Communist Party. Workers’ movement spread throughout the summer. Factory committees formed, and trade unions grew in numbers. When the Provisional Government saw its power reduced and Bolshevik influence grew, they decided to take stern measures against the spreading discontent. In the countryside, peasants and their Socialist Revolutionary leaders pressed for a redistribution of land. Encouraged by the Socialist Revolutionaries, peasants seized land between July and September 1917.

The Revolution of October 1917
The conflict between the Provisional Government and the Bolsheviks grew. On 16 October 1917, Lenin persuaded the Petrograd Soviet and the Bolshevik Party to agree to a socialist seizure of power. To organise the seizure, a Military Revolutionary Committee was appointed by the Soviet under Leon Trotskii. The Military Revolutionary Committee ordered its supporters to seize government offices and arrest ministers. By nightfall, the city was under the committee’s control and the ministers had surrendered. At a meeting of the All Russian Congress of Soviets in Petrograd, the majority approved the Bolshevik action.

What Changed after October?
Industry and banks were nationalised in November 1917, which meant that the government took over ownership and management. Land was declared as social property, and peasants were allowed to seize the land of the nobility. The Bolshevik Party was renamed the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik). Elections were conducted in November 1917 to the Constituent Assembly, but they failed in the majority. In January 1918, the Assembly rejected Bolshevik measures and Lenin dismissed the Assembly. Despite opposition, in March 1918, the Bolsheviks made peace with Germany at Brest Litovsk. The Bolsheviks participated in the elections to the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, which became the Parliament of the country. Russia became a one-party state. After October 1917, this led to experiments in the arts and architecture. But many became disillusioned because of the censorship the Party encouraged.

The Civil War
The Russian Army broke up and their leaders moved to south Russia and organised troops to fight the Bolsheviks (the ‘Reds’). During 1918 and 1919, the Russian Empire was controlled by the ‘Greens’ (Socialist Revolutionaries) and ‘Whites’ (pro-Tsarists), backed by French, American, British and Japanese troops. These troops and the Bolsheviks fought a civil war. By January 1920, the Bolsheviks controlled most of the former Russian empire. In the name of defending socialism, Bolshevik colonists brutally massacred local nationalists. Most non-Russian nationalities were given political autonomy in the Soviet Union (USSR) – the state the Bolsheviks created from the Russian empire in December 1922.

Making a Socialist Society
During the civil war, industries and banks kept nationalised. Peasants were permitted to cultivate the land. A centralised planning process was introduced. Officials worked on how the economy will work and set targets for a five-year period. During the first two ‘Plans’, the government fixed all prices to promote industrial growth (1927-1932 and 1933-1938). Centralised planning led to economic growth. But, rapid construction led to poor working conditions. A schooling system was developed, and arrangements were made for factory workers and peasants to enter universities. For women workers, crèches were established in factories for the children. Cheap public health care was provided. Model living quarters were set up for workers.

Stalinism and Collectivisation
The period of the early Planned Economy led to the disaster of the collectivisation of agriculture.

By 1927- 1928, the towns in Soviet Russia faced an acute problem of grain supplies. Stalin introduced firm emergency measures. In 1928, party members toured the grain-producing areas, supervising enforced grain collections and raiding ‘kulaks’ – the name for well-to-do peasants. After 1917, the land was given over to peasants. From 1929, the Party forced all peasants to cultivate in collective farms (kolkhoz). Peasants worked on the land, and the kolkhoz profit was shared. Between 1929 and 1931, the number of cattle fell by one-third. The government of Stalin allowed some independent cultivation but treated such cultivators unsympathetically. In spite of collectivisation, production did not increase immediately and due to bad harvests of 1930-1933, over 4 million people died. Throughout the country, accusations were made, and by 1939, over 2 million were in prisons or labour camps.

The Global Influence of the Russian Revolution and the USSR
In many countries, communist parties were formed, like the Communist Party of Great Britain. Non-Russians from outside the USSR participated in the Conference of the Peoples of the East (1920). The Bolshevik-founded Comintern (an international union of pro-Bolshevik socialist parties). Before the outbreak of the Second World War, the USSR had given socialism a global face and world stature. The USSR became a great power, and its industries and agriculture developed, and the poor were being fed. By the end of the twentieth century, the international reputation of the USSR as a socialist country had declined.

NAISM AND THE RISE OF HITLER
Birth of the Weimar Republic
In the early years of the twentieth century, Germany fought the First World War (1914-1918) alongside the Austrian Empire and against the Allies (England, France and Russia.). All resources of Europe were drained out because of the war. Germany occupied France and Belgium. But, unfortunately, the Allies, strengthened by the US entry in 1917, won, defeating Germany and the Central Powers in November 1918. At Weimar, the National Assembly met and established a democratic constitution with a federal structure. In the German Parliament, deputies were elected on the basis of equal and universal votes cast by all adults, including women. Germany lost its overseas colonies. The War Guilt Clause held Germany responsible for the war and the damages the Allied countries suffered. The Allied armies occupied Rhineland in the 1920s.

The Effects of the War
The entire continent was devastated by the war, both psychologically and financially. The war of guilt and national humiliation was carried by the Republic, which was financially crippled by being forced to pay compensation. Socialists, Catholics and Democrats supported the Weimar Republic, and they were mockingly called the ‘November criminals’. The First World War left a deep imprint on European society and polity. Soldiers are placed above civilians, but unfortunately, soldiers live a miserable life. Democracy was a young and fragile idea which could not survive the instabilities of interwar Europe.

Political Radicalism and Economic Crises
The Weimar Republic’s birth coincided with the revolutionary uprising of the Spartacist League on the pattern of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. They crushed the uprising with the help of a war veterans organisation called Free Corps. Communists and Socialists became enemies. Political radicalisation was heightened by the economic crisis of 1923. Germany refused to pay, and the French occupied its leading industrial area, Ruhr, to claim their coal. The image of Germans carrying cartloads of currency notes to buy a loaf of bread was widely publicised, evoking worldwide sympathy. This crisis came to be known as hyperinflation, a situation when prices rise phenomenally high.

The Years of Depression
The years between 1924 and 1928 saw some stability. The support of short-term loans was withdrawn when the Wall Street Exchange crashed in 1929. The Great Economic Depression started, and over the next three years, between 1929 and 1932, the national income of the USA fell by half. The economy of Germany was the worst hit. Workers became jobless and went on streets with placards saying, ‘Willing to do any work’. Youths indulged themselves in criminal activities. The middle class and small businessmen were filled with the fear of proletarianisation, anxiety of being reduced to the ranks of the working class or unemployment. Politically also, the Weimar Republic was fragile. The Weimar Constitution, due to some inherent defects, made it unstable and vulnerable to dictatorship. One inherent defect was proportional representation. Another defect was Article 48, which gave the President the powers to impose emergency, suspend civil rights and rule by decree.

Hitler’s Rise to Power
Hilter rose to power. He was born in 1889 in Austria and spent his youth in poverty. In the First World War, he enrolled on the army, acted as a messenger in the front, became a corporal, and earned medals for bravery. Hitler joined a small group called the German Workers’ Party in 1919. He took over the organisation and renamed it the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, which later came to be known as the Nazi Party. In 1923, he planned to seize control of Bavaria, march to Berlin and capture power. During the Great Depression, Nazism became a mass movement. After 1929, banks collapsed, businesses shut down, workers lost their jobs, and the middle classes were threatened with destitution. In such a situation, Nazi propaganda stirred hopes of a better future.

Hitler was a powerful speaker, and his words moved people. In his speech, he promised to build a strong nation, undo the injustice of the Versailles Treaty and restore the dignity of the German people. He also promised employment for those looking for work and a secure future for the youth. He promised to remove all foreign influences and resist all foreign ‘conspiracies’ against Germany. Hitler started following a new style of politics, and his followers held big rallies and public meetings to demonstrate support. According to the Nazi propaganda, Hitler was called a messiah, a saviour, and someone who had arrived to deliver people from their distress.

The Destruction of Democracy
President Hindenburg offered the Chancellorship, on 30 January 1933, the highest position in the cabinet of ministers, to Hitler. The Fire Decree of 28 February 1933 suspended civic rights like freedom of speech, press and assembly that had been guaranteed by the Weimar Constitution. On 3 March 1933, the famous Enabling Act was passed, which established a dictatorship in Germany. The state took control over the economy, media, army and judiciary. Apart from the already existing regular police in a green uniform and the SA or the Storm Troopers, these included the Gestapo (secret state police), the SS (the protection squads), criminal police and the Security Service (SD).

Reconstruction
Economic recovery was assigned to the economist Hjalmar Schacht by Hitler, who aimed at full production and full employment through a state-funded work-creation programme. This project produced the famous German superhighways and the people’s car, the Volkswagen. Hitler ruled out the League of Nations in 1933, reoccupied the Rhineland in 1936, and integrated Austria and Germany in 1938 under the slogan, One people, One empire and One leader. Schacht advised Hitler against investing hugely in rearmament as the state still ran on deficit financing.

The Nazi Worldview
Nazis are linked to a system of belief and a set of practices. According to their ideology, there was no equality between people but only a racial hierarchy. The racism of Hitler was borrowed from thinkers like Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. The argument of the Nazis was simple: the strongest race would survive, and the weak ones would perish. The Aryan race was the finest who retained its purity, became stronger and dominated the world. The other aspect of Hitler’s ideology related to the geopolitical concept of Lebensraum, or living space. Hitler intended to extend German boundaries by moving eastwards to concentrate all Germans geographically in one place.

Establishment of the Racial State
Nazis came into power and quickly began to implement their dream of creating an exclusive racial community of pure Germans. They wanted a society of ‘pure and healthy Nordic Aryans’. Under the Euthanasia Programme, Helmuth’s father had condemned to death many Germans who were considered mentally or physically unfit. Germany occupied Poland and parts of Russia captured civilians and forced them to work as slave labour. Jews remained the worst sufferers in Nazi Germany. Hitler hated Jews based on pseudoscientific theories of race. From 1933 to 1938, the Nazis terrorised, pauperised and segregated the Jews, compelling them to leave the country.

The Racial Utopia
Genocide and war became two sides of the same coin. Poland was divided, and much of north-western Poland was annexed to Germany.

People of Poland were forced to leave their homes and properties. Members of the Polish intelligentsia were murdered in large numbers, and Polish children who looked like Aryans were forcibly snatched from their mothers and examined by ‘race experts’.

Youth in Nazi Germany
Hitler was interested in the youth of the country. Schools were cleansed and purified. Germans and Jews were not allowed to sit or play together. In the 1940s, Jews were taken to the gas chambers. Introduction of racial science to justify Nazi ideas of race. Children were taught to be loyal and submissive, hate Jews and worship Hitler. Youth organisations were responsible for educating German youth in ‘the spirit of National Socialism’. At the age of 14, boys had to join the Nazi youth organisation where they were taught to worship war, glorify aggression and violence, condemn democracy, and hate Jews, communists, Gypsies and all those categorised as ‘undesirable’. Later, they joined the Labour Service at the age of 18 and served in the armed forces and entered one of the Nazi organisations. In 1922, the Youth League of the Nazis was founded.

The Nazi Cult of Motherhood
In Nazi Germany, children were told women were different from men. Boys were taught to be aggressive, masculine and steel-hearted and girls were told to become good mothers and rear pure-blooded Aryan children. Girls had to maintain the purity of the race, distance themselves from Jews, look after their homes and teach their children Nazi values. But all mothers were not treated equally. Honours Crosses were awarded to those who encouraged women to produce more children. Bronze cross for four children, silver for six and gold for eight or more. Women who maintained contact with Jews, Poles and Russians were paraded through the town with shaved heads, blackened faces and placards hanging around their necks announcing, ‘I have sullied the honour of the nation’.

The Art of Propaganda
Nazis termed mass killings as special treatment, the final solution (for the Jews), euthanasia (for the disabled), selection and disinfection. ‘Evacuation’ meant deporting people to gas chambers. Gas chambers were labelled as ‘‘disinfection areas’, and looked like bathrooms equipped with fake showerheads. Nazi ideas were spread through visual images, films, radio, posters, catchy slogans and leaflets. Orthodox Jews were stereotyped and marked and were referred to as vermin, rats and pests. The Nazis made equal efforts to appeal to all the different sections of the population. They sought to win their support by suggesting that Nazis alone could solve all their problems.

Ordinary People and the Crimes Against Humanity
People started seeing the world through Nazi eyes and spoke their Nazi language. They felt hatred and anger against Jews and genuinely believed Nazism would bring prosperity and improve general well-being. Pastor Niemoeller protested an uncanny silence amongst ordinary Germans against brutal and organised crimes committed in the Nazi empire. Charlotte Beradt’s book called ‘The Third Reich of Dreams’ describes how Jews themselves began believing in the Nazi stereotypes about them.

Knowledge about the Holocaust
The war ended and Germany was defeated. While Germans were preoccupied with their own plight, the Jews wanted the world to remember the atrocities and sufferings they had endured during the Nazi killing operations – also called the Holocaust. When they lost the war, the Nazi leadership distributed petrol to its functionaries to destroy all incriminating evidence available in offices.

FOREST SECURITY AND COLONISATION

Why Deforestation?
Deforestation means the disappearance of forests and is not a recent problem. It began many centuries ago, but under colonial rule, it became more systematic and extensive.

Land to be Improved
Over the centuries, as the population grew and the demand for food went up, peasants started clearing forests and breaking new land. British encouraged the production of commercial crops like jute, sugar, wheat and cotton. In the 19th century, the demand for these crops increased. The colonial state thought that forests were unproductive in the early 19th century. So between 1880 and 1920, cultivated areas and the expansion of cultivation showed a sign of progress.

Sleepers on the Tracks
In England, by the early nineteenth century, oak forests were disappearing. Search parties were sent to India to explore the forest resources. Railways spread from the 1850s. Railways were essential for colonial trade and for the movement of imperial troops. From the 1860s, the railway network expanded rapidly. Trees started falling as the railway tracks spread through India. The government gave out contracts to individuals to supply the required quantities. Forests around the railway tracks started disappearing.

Plantations
Large areas of natural forests were cleared to make way for tea, coffee and rubber plantations to meet Europe’s growing need for these commodities. The forests were taken over by the colonial government, which gave vast areas to European planters at cheap rates to plant tea or coffee.

The Rise of Commercial Forestry
British were worried that the reckless use of trees by traders and the use of forests by local people would destroy forests. Dietrich Brandis, a German expert, became the first Inspector General of Forests in India. He realised that a proper system had to be introduced to manage the forests, and people needed to be trained in the science of conservation. But it needed legal sanction. In 1864, Indian Forest Service was set up in Dehradun in 1906. In scientific forestry, natural forests, which had lots of different types of trees, were cut down. In 1906, the Forest Act was enacted, which was amended twice, once in 1878 and then in 1927. The Act of 1878 divided forests into three categories: reserved, protected and village forests. The best forests were called ‘reserved forests’.

How Were the Lives of People Affected?
Villagers wanted forests with species of different types to satisfy their needs for fuel, fodder and leaves. On the other hand, the forest department wanted trees like teak and sal suitable for building ships or railways. Roots, leaves, fruits and tubers were used for many things. In the forest, almost everything was available such as herbs, yokes, ploughs, bamboo, etc. From the fruit of the mahua tree, oil was extracted for the purpose of cooking and lighting lamps. The Forest Act meant severe hardship for villagers across the country. People were forced to steal wood from the forests. Forest guards used to take bribes if they got caught. Police constables and forest guards harass people by demanding free food from them.

How Did Forest Rules Affect Cultivation?
The practice of shifting cultivation or swidden cultivation was introduced during European colonialism or swidden agriculture. It is a traditional agricultural practice in many parts of Asia, Africa and South America. In shifting cultivation, parts of the forest are cut and burnt in rotation. After the first monsoon rains, seeds are sown in the ashes, and the crop is harvested by October-November. For a couple of years, such plots are cultivated and then left for 12 to 18 years. On these plots, a mixture of crops is grown. According to European foresters, this practice is harmful to the forests. This type of cultivation also made it difficult for the government to calculate taxes. So, the government decided to ban shifting cultivation.

Who Could Hunt?
People who lived near forests survived by hunting deer, partridges and a variety of small animals. The practice was prohibited by the forest laws, and those who were caught hunting were punished for poaching. In India, hunting of tigers and other animals is a part of the culture of the court and nobility for centuries. The scale of hunting increased under colonial rule to such an extent that various species became almost extinct. Rewards were given for killing wild animals. Some areas of the forest were reserved for hunting.

New Trades, New Employment and New Services
New opportunities opened up in trade. In India, forest trade was not new. It existed from the medieval period when Adivasi communities used to trade elephants and other goods like hides, horns, silk cocoons, ivory, bamboo, spices, fibres, grasses, gums and resins through nomadic communities like the Banjaras. But, trade was completely regulated by the government, which gave many large European trading firms the sole right to trade in the forest products of particular areas. New opportunities for work did not improve the well-being of the people.

Rebellion in the Forest
Forest communities rebelled against the changes that were being imposed on them. Some of the leaders of these movements are the Siddhu and Kanu in the Santhal Parganas, Birsa Munda of Chhotanagpur or Alluri Sitarama Raju of Andhra Pradesh.

The People of Bastar
Bastar is located in the southernmost part of Chhattisgarh and borders Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Maharashtra. The Bastar central part is on a plateau, and to the north is the Chhattisgarh Plain and to its south is the Godavari Plain. Different communities live in Bastar, such as Maria and Muria Gonds, Dhurwas, Bhatras and Halbas. The people of Bastar believed that each village was given its land by the Earth, and in return, they looked after the Earth by making some offerings at each agricultural festival. Local villagers look after all the natural resources within their boundaries, and people pay a small fee called devsari, dand or man in exchange if they want to take some wood from the forests of another village.

The Fears of the People
In 1905, the colonial government proposed to reserve two-thirds of the forest and stop shifting cultivation, hunting and collection of forest produce. Some people used to stay in forests by working for free for the forest department, and these are called forest villagers. Villagers, in the long run, suffered from increased land rents and frequent demands for labour and goods. People started discussing these issues in their village councils, bazaars, and festivals. Dhurwas of the Kanger forest took the initiative where reservation first took place. Bazaars were looted, the houses of officials and traders, schools and police stations were burnt and robbed, and grain was redistributed. British troops were sent to suppress the rebellion. After Independence, the same practice of keeping people out of the forests and reserving them for industrial use continued.

Forest Transformations in Java
Java is famous as a rice-producing island in Indonesia. But, there was a time when it was covered mostly with forests. In Java, the Dutch started forest management. Villages existed in the fertile plains, and there were also many communities living in the mountains and practising shifting cultivation.

The Woodcutters of Java
The Kalangs of Java were skilled forest cutters and shifting cultivators. They are experts in harvesting teak and for the kings to build their palaces. When the Dutch began to gain control over the forests in the eighteenth century, they tried to make the Kalangs work under them. In 1770, the Kalangs resisted by attacking a Dutch fort at Joana, but the uprising was suppressed.

Dutch Scientific Forestry
In the nineteenth century, the Dutch enacted forest laws in Java, restricting villagers’ access to forests. Wood could only be cut for making riverboats or constructing houses. Villagers were punished for grazing cattle, transporting wood without a permit, or travelling on forest roads with horse carts or cattle. Firstly, the Dutch imposed rents on land being cultivated in the forest and then exempted some villages from these rents if they worked collectively to provide free labour and buffaloes for cutting and transporting timber. This was known as the blandongdiensten system.

Samin’s Challenge
Surontiko Samin of Randublatung village, a teak forest village, questioned the state ownership of the forest and argued that the state had not created the wind, water, earth and wood, so it could not own it. Soon a widespread movement developed. Some of the Saminists protested by lying down on their land when the Dutch came to survey it, while others refused to pay taxes or fines or perform labour.

War and Deforestation
The First World War and the Second World War had a major impact on forests. In Java, the Dutch followed ‘a scorched Earth policy’, destroying sawmills and burning huge piles of giant teak logs. After the war, it was difficult for the Indonesian forest service to get this land back.

New Developments in Forestry
Conservation of forests has become a more important goal. In many places, across India, from Mizoram to Kerala, dense forests have survived only because villages protected them in sacred groves known as sarnas, devarakudu, kan, rai, etc.

PASTORALISTS IN THE MORDERN WORLD

Pastoral Nomads and their Movements
In the Mountains
In the nineteenth century, Gujjar Bakarwals of Jammu and Kashmir migrated to the mountains in search of pastures for their animals. During the winter, they moved to the low hills of the Siwalik range. By the end of April, they began their northern march for their summer grazing grounds. This journey is known as a kafila. Again, they started their march by the end of September, this time back to their winter base. The Gaddi shepherds of Himachal Pradesh also had a similar cycle of seasonal movement.

The Gujjar cattle herds from the further east came down to the dry forests of the Bhabar in the winter and went up to the high meadows – the Bugyals – in summer. This pattern of cyclical movement between summer and winter pastures was typical of many pastoral communities of the Himalayas, including the Bhotiyas, Sherpas and Kinnauris.

On the Plateaus, Plains and Deserts
Pastoralists were also found in the plateaus, plains and deserts of India. In Maharashtra, Dhangars were an important pastoral community that were mostly shepherds, blanket weavers, and buffalo herders. During the monsoon, they used to stay in the central plateau of Maharashtra. By October, the Dhangars harvest their bajra and move to the west. After they reached Konkan, they were welcomed by Konkani peasants. After the Kharif harvest was cut, the fields had to be fertilised and made ready for the rabi harvest.

In the state of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the dry central plateau was covered with stone and grass, inhabited by cattle, goats, and sheepherders called Gollas herded cattle. The Kurumas and Kurubas reared sheep and goats and sold woven blankets. During the dry season, they moved to the coastal tracts and left when the rains came. Banjaras were yet another well-known group of graziers found in the villages of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

Raikas lived in the deserts of Rajasthan. During the monsoons, the Raikas of Barmer, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Bikaner stayed in their villages, where pasture was available. By October, they moved out in search of other pastures and water and returned again during the next monsoon.

Pastoral groups’ life was sustained by a host of factors. They had to judge how long the herds could stay in one area and where they could find water and pasture. They needed to calculate the timing of their movements and ensure that they could move through different territories. They had to set up a relationship with farmers on the way so that the herds could graze in harvested fields and manure the soil.

Colonial Rule and Pastoral Life
Pastoralists’ life changed completely under colonial rule. Their movements were regulated, grazing grounds shrank, and the revenue they had to pay increased. Even their agricultural stock declined, and their trades and crafts were adversely affected. It happened due to the following reasons:

Land revenue was one of the main sources of finance for the colonial state. So, the colonial government wanted to transform all grazing lands into cultivated farms through which they could expand cultivation and increase their revenue collection. All uncultivated land was seen as ‘wasteland’. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land Rules were enacted in various parts of the country. Under these rules, uncultivated lands were taken over and given to select individuals.
By the mid-nineteenth century, various Forest Acts were being enacted in different provinces. According to these Acts, forests which produced commercially valuable timber like deodar or sal were declared ‘Reserved’, and other forests were classified as ‘Protected’. These Forest Acts changed the lives of pastoralists as they were prevented from entering many forests.
British officials were suspicious of nomadic people. The colonial government wanted to rule over a settled population. In 1871, the colonial government in India passed the Criminal Tribes Act. By this Act, many communities of craftsmen, traders and pastoralists were classified as Criminal Tribes. They were stated to be criminals by nature and birth.
Taxation was imposed on land, canal water, salt, trade goods, and even on animals. In most pastoral tracts of India, a grazing tax was introduced in the mid-nineteenth century. In the decades between the 1850s and 1880s, the right to collect the tax was auctioned out to contractors. By the 1880s, the government began collecting taxes directly from the pastoralists.
How Did These Changes Affect the Lives of Pastoralists?
Due to these measures, there was a shortage of pastures. When grazing lands were taken over and turned into cultivated fields, the available area of pastureland declined. As pasturelands disappeared under the plough, the existing animal stock had to feed on whatever grazing land remained. When restrictions were imposed on pastoral movements, grazing lands came to be continuously used and the quality of pastures declined. This, in turn, created a further shortage of forage for animals and the deterioration of animal stock.

How Did the Pastoralists Cope with These Changes?
Pastoralists reacted to these changes in various ways. They reduced the number of cattle and some discovered new pastures. After 1947, the new political boundaries between India and Pakistan stopped the camel and sheep herding Raikas to graze their camels on the banks of the Indus. Over the years, some richer pastoralists bought land and settled down, giving up their nomadic life. Some became peasants by cultivating land, others indulged in trading. On the other hand, poor pastoralists borrowed money from moneylenders to survive. They still continued to survive and in many regions, their numbers have expanded. In many other parts of the world, new laws and settlement patterns forced pastoral communities to alter their lives.

Pastoralism in Africa
In Africa, even today, over 22 million Africans depend on some form of pastoral activity for their livelihood. Like pastoralists in India, the lives of African pastoralists have changed dramatically over the colonial and post-colonial periods.

Where Have the Grazing Lands Gone?
Before colonial times, Maasailand stretched over a vast area from north Kenya to the steppes of northern Tanzania. In 1885, it was cut into half with an international boundary between British Kenya and German Tanganyika. After the cut, the best grazing lands were gradually taken over for white settlement and the Maasai were pushed into a small area in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. From the late nineteenth century, the British colonial government in East Africa encouraged local peasant communities to expand cultivation. In pre-colonial times, the Maasai pastoralists had dominated their agricultural neighbours both economically and politically. The loss of the finest grazing lands and water resources created pressure on the small area of land that the Maasai were confined within.

The Borders are Closed
In the nineteenth century, African pastoralists could move over vast areas in search of pastures. But, from the late nineteenth century, the colonial government began imposing various restrictions on their mobility. White settlers and European colonists saw pastoralists as dangerous and savage. The new territorial boundaries and restrictions imposed on them suddenly changed the lives of pastoralists, which adversely affected both their pastoral and trading activities.

When Pastures Dry
Pastoralists’ lives were affected by drought everywhere. That is why, traditionally, pastoralists move from place to place to survive bad times and avoid crises. But from the colonial period, the Maasai were bound down to a fixed area, confined within a reserve, and prohibited from moving in search of pastures. As the area of grazing lands shrank, the adverse effect of the droughts increased in intensity.

Not All Were Equally Affected
In Maasailand, not all pastoralists were equally affected by the changes in the colonial period. In pre-colonial times Maasai society was divided into two social categories – elders and warriors. The elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic councils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes. The warriors consisted of younger people, mainly responsible for the protection of the tribe and defended the community and organised cattle raids.

The British introduced a series of measures that had important implications for administering the affairs of the Maasai. They appointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were made responsible for the affairs of the tribe. Restrictions were also imposed on raiding and warfare. These chiefs managed to survive the devastations of war and drought.

But the life history of the poor pastoralists was different. In times of war and famine, they lost nearly everything. They had to go looking for work in the towns. Some used to work as charcoal burners, and some did odd jobs to earn their living.

The social changes in Maasai society occurred at two levels. First, the traditional difference based on age between the elders and warriors was disturbed, though it did not break down entirely. Second, a new distinction between the wealthy and poor pastoralists developed.

Conclusion
Pastoral communities in different parts of the world are affected in different ways by changes in the modern world. Their pattern of movement was affected by new laws and new borders. Pastoralists find it difficult to move in search of pastures and grazing becomes difficult. During the time of drought, cattle die in large numbers. Yet, pastoralists do adapt to new times. They change the paths of their annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights to enter new areas, exert political pressure on the government for relief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in the management of forests and water resources.


GEOGRAPHY
INDIA SIZE AND LOCATION
Location
India is lying entirely in the Northern Hemisphere, as shown in the figure below.

The land extends between latitudes 8°4’N and 37°6’N and longitudes 68°7’E and 97°25’E.
The Tropic of Cancer (23° 30’N) divides India into almost two equal parts.
Size
India’s total area accounts for about 2.4% of the total geographical area of the world. Thus, it is the 7th largest country in the world by its size.

India has a land boundary of about 15,200 km.
The total length of the coastline of the mainland is 7,516.6 km including Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep.
India is bounded by the mountains in the northwest, north and northeast. South of about 22° north latitude, it begins to taper and extends towards the Indian Ocean, dividing it into two seas, the Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of Bengal on its east.
Time along the Standard Meridian of India (82°30’E) passing through Mirzapur (in Uttar Pradesh) is taken as the standard time for India.
The map below shows the Extent of India and the Standard Meridian.

India and the World
The Indian landmass has a central location between the East and West Asia. India is a southward extension of the Asian continent. The trans-Indian Ocean routes connect the countries of Europe in the West and the countries of East Asia. No other country has as long a coastline on the Indian Ocean as India has. India’s contacts with the World have continued through the ages. The spices, muslin and other merchandise were taken from India to different countries. On the other hand, the influence of Greek sculpture and the architectural styles of domes and minarets from West Asia can be seen in different parts of India.

India’s Neighbours
India has 28 states and eight Union Territories. India shares its land boundaries with:

Pakistan and Afghanistan in the northwest
China (Tibet), Nepal and Bhutan in the north
Myanmar and Bangladesh in the east
The southern neighbours across the sea consist of the two island countries, Sri Lanka and Maldives. India has had strong geographical and historical links with its neighbours.

PHYSICAL FEATURES OF INDIA
Major Physiographic Divisions
The physical features of India are grouped under the following physiographic divisions:

The Himalayan Mountains
The Northern Plains
The Peninsular Plateau
The Indian Desert
The Coastal Plains
The Islands
Let’s discuss each of them in detail.

The Himalayan Mountains
Himalayan mountains are stretched over the northern borders of India. This mountain ranges run in a west-east direction from the Indus to the Brahmaputra. The Himalayas consists of 3 parallel ranges in their longitudinal extent.

The northernmost range is known as the Great or Inner Himalayas or the Himadri. It is the most continuous range consisting of the loftiest peaks with an average height of 6,000 metres.
The folds of the Great Himalayas are asymmetrical in nature. The core of this part of the Himalayas is composed of granite.
The range lying to the south of the Himadri forms the most rugged mountain system and is known as Himachal or lesser Himalaya.
Pir Panjal range forms the longest and the most important range.
The outermost range of the Himalayas is called the Shiwaliks. These ranges are composed of unconsolidated sediments.
The longitudinal valley lying between the lesser Himalayas and the Shiwaliks is known as Duns. Dehradun, Kotli Dun and Patli Dun are some of the well-known Duns.
The Himalayas have also been divided on the basis of regions from west to east.

The part of the Himalayas lying between Indus and Satluj has been traditionally known as Punjab Himalaya but it is also known regionally as Kashmir and Himachal Himalaya from west to east, respectively.
The part of the Himalayas lying between the Satluj and the Kali rivers is known as Kumaon Himalayas.
The Kali and Teesta rivers divide the Nepal Himalayas and the part lying between Teesta and Dihang rivers is known as Assam Himalayas.
The Brahmaputra marks the easternmost boundary of the Himalayas.
Beyond the Dihang gorge, the Himalayas bend sharply to the south and spread along the eastern boundary of India, which is known as the Purvachal or the Eastern hills and mountains. The Purvachal comprises the Patkai Hills, the Naga Hills, the Manipur Hills and the Mizo Hills.
The Northern Plain
The northern plain has been formed by the interplay of the 3 major river systems – the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra along with their tributaries. It spreads over an area of 7 lahks sq. km.

The Northern Plain is broadly divided into 3 sections, as mentioned below:

The Western part of the Northern Plain is referred to as the Punjab Plains. This plain is formed by the Indus and its tributaries – the Jhelum, the Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas and the Satluj.
The Ganga plain extends between Ghaggar and Teesta rivers. It is spread over the states of North India, Haryana, Delhi, U.P., Bihar, partly Jharkhand and West Bengal.
Brahmaputra Plain lies in the state of Assam.
According to the variations in elevation points, the Northern plains can be divided into 4 regions.

The rivers, after descending from the mountains, deposit pebbles in a narrow belt of about 8 to 16 km in width, lying parallel to the slopes of the Shiwaliks, which is known as Bhabar. All the streams disappear in this Bhabar belt.
The streams and rivers re-emerge and create a wet, swampy and marshy region known as terai.
The largest part of the northern plain is formed of older alluvium. It lies above the floodplains of the rivers and presents a terrace-like feature which is known as Bhangar.
The soil in the Bhangar region contains calcareous deposits and is known as Kankar. The newer, younger deposits of the floodplains are called Khadar.
The Peninsular Plateau
The Peninsular Plateau is a tableland composed of old crystalline, igneous and metamorphic rocks. It was formed due to the breaking and drifting of the Gondwana land. One of the distinct features of the Peninsular Plateau is the black soil area known as Deccan Trap.

This plateau consists of 2 divisions:

The Central Highlands: The part of the Peninsular plateau lying to the north of the Narmada River, covering a major area of the Malwa plateau, is known as the Central Highlands. The eastward extensions of this plateau are locally known as the Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand.
The Deccan Plateau: It is a triangular landmass that lies to the south of the river Narmada. An extension of the Plateau is also visible in the northeast, which is known as the Meghalaya, Karbi-Anglong Plateau and North Cachar Hills.
The Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats mark the western and the eastern edges of the Deccan Plateau, respectively.

Western Ghats	Eastern Ghats
Western Ghats lie parallel to the western coast.	The Eastern Ghats stretch from the Mahanadi Valley to the Nilgiris in the South.
They are continuous and can be crossed through passes only.	They are discontinuous and irregular. They can be dissected by rivers draining into the Bay of Bengal.
They are higher than the Eastern Ghats. Their average elevation is 900–1600 metres.	Their average elevation is 600 metres.
Anamudi is the highest peak in the Western Ghats.	Mahendragiri (1,501 metres) is the highest peak in the Eastern Ghats.
The Indian Desert
The Indian desert lies towards the western margins of the Aravali Hills.

It is a sandy plain covered with sand dunes.
This region receives very low rainfall, below 150 mm per year.
It has a dry climate with low vegetation cover.
The Coastal Plains
A coastal plain is a flat, low-lying piece of land next to the ocean. To the east and west of the peninsular plateau, 2 narrow strips of plain lands are found, which are respectively called Eastern Coastal Plain and Western Coastal Plain.

Eastern Coastal Plain

The Eastern Coastal Plains is a wide stretch of landmass lying between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal. In the northern part, it is referred to as the Northern Circar, while the southern part is known as the Coromandel Coast. Large rivers, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri, have formed an extensive delta on this coast. Lake Chilika is an important feature along the eastern coast.

Western Coastal Plain

The western coast is sandwiched between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea. It is a narrow plain and consists of 3 sections, as mentioned below:

The northern part of the coast is called the Konkan (Mumbai – Goa)
The central stretch is called the Kannad Plain
The southern stretch is referred to as the Malabar coast
The Islands
An island is a piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Lakshadweep Islands group is composed of small coral islands which were earlier known as Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindive.

The entire group of islands is divided into 2 broad categories:

The Andaman in the north
The Nicobar in the south
These islands lie close to the equator and experience an equatorial climate, and have thick forest cover.

The diverse physical features of India have immense future possibilities for development because of the following reasons.

The mountains are the major sources of water and forest wealth.
The northern plains are the granaries of the country. They provide the base for early civilisations.
The plateau is a storehouse of minerals, which has played a crucial role in the industrialisation of India.
The coastal region and island groups provide sites for fishing and port activities.

DRAINAGE

The area drained by a single river system is called a drainage basin. Any elevated area, such as a mountain or an upland which separates two drainage basins, is known as a water divide.

Drainage Systems in India
The Indian rivers are divided into two major groups:

The Himalayan rivers
The Peninsular rivers
The Himalayan rivers	The Peninsular rivers
Most of the Himalayan rivers are perennial, which means they have water throughout the year.	Peninsular rivers are seasonal.
These rivers receive water from rain as well as from melted snow from high mountains.	The flow of these rivers is dependent on rainfall.
Two major Himalayan rivers, the Indus and the Brahmaputra originate from the north of the mountain ranges.	Most of the rivers of peninsular India originate in the Western Ghats and flow towards the Bay of Bengal.
The Himalayan rivers have long courses from their source to the sea.	These rivers have shorter and shallower courses as compared to the Himalayan rivers.
The Himalayan Rivers
The major Himalayan rivers are the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. A river, along with its tributaries, may be called a river system.

1) The Indus River System
Indus is one of the longest rivers in the world, with a total length of 2900 km.
The river Indus rises in Tibet near Lake Mansarovar.
It enters India in the Ladakh district of Jammu and Kashmir, where it forms a picturesque gorge.
The Satluj, the Beas, the Ravi, the Chenab and the Jhelum join together to enter the Indus near Mithankot in Pakistan.
2) The Ganga River System
The source of the Ganga called the ‘Bhagirathi’, is fed by the Gangotri Glacier and joined by the Alaknanda at Devaprayag in Uttarakhand.
The Ganga emerges from the mountains to the plains at Haridwar.
The Ganga is joined by many tributaries from the Himalayas, a few of them being major rivers, such as the Yamuna, the Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi.
The length of the Ganga is over 2500 km.
Farakka in West Bengal is the northernmost point of the Ganga Delta where the Ganga River divides into 2 parts.

The Bhagirathi-Hooghly flows southwards through the deltaic plains to the Bay of Bengal.
The mainstream flows southwards into Bangladesh and is joined by the Brahmaputra. Further downstream, it is known as the Meghna. The Meghna River flows into the Bay of Bengal and forms Sundarban Delta.
3) The Brahmaputra River System
The Brahmaputra rises in Tibet east of Mansarowar Lake.
It is slightly longer than the Indus.
On reaching the Namcha Barwa (7757 m), it takes a ‘U-turn’ and enters India in Arunachal Pradesh, where it is called the Dihang.
Dihang is joined by the Dibang, the Lohit, and many other tributaries to form the Brahmaputra in Assam.
The Peninsular Rivers
The main water divide in Peninsular India is formed by the Western Ghats. Most of the major rivers of the Peninsula, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna, and the Kaveri, flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal. These rivers make deltas at their mouths. The Narmada and the Tapi are the only long rivers which flow west and make estuaries.

1) The Narmada Basin
The Narmada rises in the Amarkantak hills in Madhya Pradesh.
The Narmada flows through a deep gorge at the ‘Marble Rocks’ near Jabalpur.
At Dhuadhar Falls, the river jumps over steep rocks.
The Narmada basin covers parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.
2) The Tapi Basin
The Tapi rises in the Satpura ranges in the Betul district of Madhya Pradesh.
Its basin covers parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
3) The Godavari Basin
The Godavari is the largest Peninsular river. Its length is about 1500 km.
It rises from the slopes of the Western Ghats in the Nasik district of Maharashtra.
The basin covers parts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.
The Godavari is joined by a number of tributaries, such as the Purna, the Wardha, the Pranhita, the Manjra, the Wainganga and the Penganga.
Owing to its length and the area it covers, it is also known as the Dakshin Ganga.
4) The Mahanadi Basin
The Mahanadi rises in the highlands of Chhattisgarh.
The length of the river is about 860 km.
Its drainage basin is shared by Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Odisha.
5) The Krishna Basin
It rises from a spring near Mahabaleshwar.
The length of the river is about 1400 km.
Its drainage basin is shared by Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
6) The Kaveri Basin
The Kaveri rises in the Brahmagri range of the Western Ghats.
The total length of the river is about 760 km.
Its basin drains parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
Besides these major rivers, there are some smaller rivers flowing towards the east. Some of them are:

The Damodar
The Brahmani
The Baitarni
The Subarnrekha
Lakes
India has many lakes. These lakes differ from each other in size and other characteristics.

Most lakes are permanent
Some contain water only during the rainy season
Some lakes are the result of the action of glaciers and ice sheets
Some have been formed by wind, river action and human activities
These lakes are attractive to tourists in places like Srinagar, Nainital. Different lakes are:

A meandering river across a floodplain forms cut-offs that later develop into ox-bow lakes.
Spits and bars form lagoons in the coastal areas. Eg, the Chilika Lake, the Pulicat Lake and the Kolleru Lake.
Lakes in the region of inland drainage are sometimes seasonal. For example, the Sambhar Lake in Rajasthan is a saltwater lake which is used for producing salt.
Most of the freshwater lakes are in the Himalayan region. They are of glacial origin. The Wular Lake in Jammu and Kashmir is the result of tectonic activity, which is the largest freshwater lake in India. Some other important freshwater lakes are Dal Lake, Bhimtal, Nainital, Loktak and Barapani.
Importance of Lakes
Lakes are useful to human beings in many ways:

Lakes help to regulate the flow of a river.
During heavy rains, these lakes prevent flooding.
During the dry season, these lakes help to maintain an even flow of water.
Lakes can also be used for developing hydel power.
Lakes moderate the surrounding climate, maintain the aquatic ecosystem, enhance natural beauty, and provide recreation.
Role of Rivers in the Economy
Rivers have been of fundamental importance throughout human history.
Water from rivers is a basic natural resource, essential for various human activities.
Rivers are used for irrigation, navigation, hydropower generation etc.
River Pollution
The growing domestic, municipal, industrial and agricultural demand for water from rivers is affecting the quality of water. Rivers are getting polluted as a heavy load of untreated sewage and industrial effluents are getting emptied into the rivers. Concern over rising river pollution led to the launching of various action plans to clean the rivers.

CLIMATE
Climate refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a large area for a long period of time (more than thirty years).

Weather refers to the state of the atmosphere over an area at any point in time.

The elements of weather and climate are the same, i.e. temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity and precipitation. On the basis of the monthly atmospheric conditions, the year is divided into seasons such as:

Winter
Summer
Rainy Seasons
Climatic Controls
The climate of any place depends on the following factors:

1) Latitude

The amount of solar energy received varies according to latitude due to the curvature of the earth. That’s why air temperature generally decreases from the equator towards the poles.

2) Altitude

The atmosphere becomes less dense, and temperature decreases when we go to a higher altitude from the Earth’s surface. This is the reason why hills are cooler during summer.

3) Pressure and wind system

The pressure and wind system of any area depend on the latitude and altitude of the place. It influences the temperature and rainfall pattern.

4) Distance from the sea

The sea exerts a moderating influence on the climate. As the distance from the sea increases, its moderating influence decreases and people experience extreme weather conditions. This condition is known as continentality, i.e. very hot during summers and very cold during winters.

5) Ocean currents

Ocean currents, along with onshore winds, affect the climate of the coastal areas. For example, any coastal area with warm or cold currents flowing past it will be warmed or cooled if the winds are onshore.

6) Relief features

Relief plays a major role in determining the climate of a place. High mountains act as barriers to cold or hot winds. They may also cause precipitation if they are high enough and lie in the path of rain-bearing winds. Precipitation is any form of moisture which falls to the earth. It includes rain, snow, hail and sleet.

Factors Affecting India’s Climate
Latitude
The Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle of the country from the Rann of Kachchh in the west to Mizoram in the east. India’s climate has characteristics of tropical as well as subtropical climates.

Altitude
India has mountains to the north and also has a vast coastal area where the maximum elevation is about 30 metres. Owing to the mountains, the subcontinent experiences comparatively milder winters as compared to central Asia.

Pressure and winds
The climate and weather conditions in India are governed by the following atmospheric conditions:

Pressure and surface winds
Upper air circulation
Western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones
Air moves from the high-pressure area over the southern Indian Ocean in a south-easterly direction, crosses the equator and turns right towards the low-pressure areas over the Indian subcontinent. These are known as the Southwest Monsoon winds. These winds blow over the warm oceans, gather moisture and bring widespread rainfall over the territories of India.

Jet streams are fast-flowing, narrow, meandering air currents in the atmosphere.

The Indian Monsoon
The climate of India is strongly influenced by monsoon winds. The seasonal reversal of the

wind system is known as “monsoon”. The monsoons are experienced in the tropical area roughly between 20° N and 20° S. Go through the following facts to understand the mechanism of the monsoons in a better way:

The differential heating and cooling of land and water create a low pressure on the landmass of India while the seas around experience comparatively high pressure.
The shift of the position of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in summer over the Ganga plain is also known as the monsoon trough during the monsoon season.
The presence of the high-pressure area east of Madagascar, approximately 20°S over the Indian Ocean, affects the Indian Monsoon.
The Tibetan plateau gets intensely heated during summer, which results in strong vertical air currents and the formation of low pressure over the plateau at about 9 km above sea level.
The movement of the westerly jet stream to the north of the Himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the Indian peninsula during summer also impact the Indian Monsoon.
The changes in the pressure conditions over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons. The irregularly periodic variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean that affects the climate of the tropics and subtropics is known as Southern Oscillation or SO.

The Onset of the Monsoon and Withdrawal
The duration of the monsoon is between 100-120 days from early June to mid-September. Around the time of its arrival, the normal rainfall increases suddenly and continues constantly for several days, which is known as the “burst” of the monsoon.

Arrival of the Monsoon in Different Parts of India
The monsoon arrives at the southern tip of the Indian peninsula generally by the 1st week of June. Subsequently, it proceeds into two – the Arabian Sea branch and the Bay of Bengal branch.

The Arabian Sea branch reaches Mumbai on approximately the 10th of June.
The Bay of Bengal branch arrives in Assam in the 1st week of June.
By mid-June, the Arabian Sea branch of the monsoon arrives over Saurashtra-Kuchchh and the central part of the country.
The Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal branches of the monsoon merge over the northwestern part of the Ganga plains.
Delhi receives the monsoon showers from the Bay of Bengal branch by the end of June.
By the first week of July, western Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and eastern Rajasthan experience the monsoon.
By mid-July, the monsoon reaches Himachal Pradesh and the rest of the country.
Withdrawal of the Monsoon
The withdrawal of the monsoon begins in the northwestern states of India by early September. By mid-October, it withdraws completely from the northern half of the peninsula. From north to south, the withdrawal of monsoon takes place from the first week of December to the first week of January. By early December, the monsoon has withdrawn from the rest of the country.

The Seasons
4 main seasons can be identified in India:

The cold weather season (Winter)
The hot weather season (Summer)
The advancing monsoon (Rainy Season)
The retreating monsoon with some regional variations (Transition Season)
Let’s discuss each of them in detail:

The Cold Weather Season (Winter)
Winter begins in mid-November in northern India and stays till February.

December and January are the coldest months in the northern part of India.
The temperature decreases from the south to the north.
Days are warm and nights are cold.
The weather is marked by clear sky, low temperatures and low humidity and feeble, variable winds.
This season is extremely important for the cultivation of ‘rabi’ crops.
The Hot Weather Season (Summer)
From March to May, a hot weather season is observed in India. The summer months experience rising temperatures and falling air pressure in the northern part of the country. A striking feature of the hot weather season is the ‘loo’. Loo is the strong, gusty, hot, dry winds blowing during the day over north and northwestern India.

Towards the close of the summer season, pre-monsoon showers come, which help in the early ripening of mangoes and are often referred to as ‘mango showers’.

Advancing Monsoon (The Rainy Season)
South-east trade winds originate over the warm subtropical areas of the southern oceans. They cross the equator and blow in a southwesterly direction entering the Indian peninsula as the southwest monsoon. The monsoon winds cover the country for about a month. Mawsynram in the southern ranges of the Khasi Hills receives the highest average rainfall in the world.

A phenomenon associated with the monsoon is its tendency to have ‘breaks’ in rainfall. These breaks in monsoon are related to the movement of the monsoon trough. The trough and its axis keep on moving northward or southward and determine the spatial distribution of rainfall. The

frequency and intensity of tropical depressions also determine the amount and duration of monsoon rains. The monsoon is known for its uncertainties. The alternation of dry and wet spells varies in intensity, frequency and duration.

Retreating/Post Monsoons (The Transition Season)
The months of October-November form a period of transition from hot rainy season to dry winter conditions. The retreat of the monsoon is marked by clear skies and a rise in temperature. While day temperatures are high, nights are cool and pleasant. Owing to the conditions of high temperature and humidity, the weather becomes rather oppressive during the day. This is commonly known as ‘October heat’. In the second half of October, the mercury begins to fall rapidly in northern India.

Distribution of Rainfall
Parts of the western coast and northeastern India receive over about 400 cm of rainfall annually.
Rainfall is less than 60 cm in western Rajasthan and adjoining parts of Gujarat, Haryana and Punjab.
Rainfall is low in the interior of the Deccan plateau and east of the Sahyadris.
Snowfall is restricted to the Himalayan region.
The annual rainfall is highly variable from year to year.
Monsoon as a Unifying Bond
The unifying influence of the monsoon on the Indian subcontinent is quite noticeable. The seasonal alteration of the wind systems and the associated weather conditions provide a rhythmic cycle of seasons. The uncertainties of rain and uneven distribution are very much typical of the monsoons. Year after year, the people of India, from north to south and from east to west, eagerly await the arrival of the monsoon. These monsoon winds bind the whole country by providing water to set agricultural activities in motion.

NATURAL VEGETATION IN WILDLIFE

Natural vegetation refers to a plant community which has grown naturally without human aid and has been left undisturbed by humans for a long time. This is termed virgin vegetation.

The term flora is used to denote plants of a particular region or period. The species of animals are referred to as fauna. This huge diversity in the flora and fauna kingdom is due to the following factors:

1) Relief
Land
Land affects natural vegetation directly and indirectly.

The fertile level is generally devoted to agriculture.
The undulating and rough terrains are areas where grassland and woodlands develop and give shelter to a variety of wildlife.
Soil
Different types of soils provide a basis for different types of vegetation.

The sandy soils of the desert support cactus and thorny bushes, while wet, marshy, deltaic soils support mangroves and deltaic vegetation.
The soil at the hill slopes has conical trees.
2) Climate
Temperature
The character and extent of vegetation are mainly determined by temperature along with humidity in the air, precipitation and soil. The fall in the temperature affects the vegetation and its growth.

Photoperiod (Sunlight)
The variation in the duration of sunlight at different places is due to differences in latitude, altitude, season and duration of the day. Due to the longer duration of sunlight, trees grow faster in summer.

Precipitation
Areas of heavy rainfall have more dense vegetation as compared to areas of less rainfall.

Types of Vegetation
In India, the following major types of vegetation are found:

Tropical Evergreen Forests
Tropical Deciduous Forests
Tropical Thorn Forests and Scrubs
Montane Forests
Mangrove Forests
Let’s study them in detail.

Tropical Evergreen Forests
These forests are present in the Western Ghats and the island groups of Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar, upper parts of Assam and Tamil Nadu coast.

These forests grow best in areas having rainfall of more than 200 cm with a short dry season.
The trees reach great heights, up to 60 metres or even above.
It has vegetation of all kinds, i.e., trees, shrubs and creepers, giving it a multilayered structure.
These forests appear green all the year-round.
Important trees of this forest are ebony, mahogany, rosewood, rubber and cinchona.
Common animals found in these forests are elephants, monkeys, lemurs and deer.
Tropical Deciduous Forests
These forests are also called monsoon forests.

They are spread over the region, having rainfall between 200 cm and 70 cm.
They shed their leaves about 6 to 8 weeks in the dry summer.
In these forests, the common animals found are lions, tigers, pigs, deer and elephants.
These forests are further divided into:

Moist deciduous: These are found in areas having rainfall between 200 and 100 cm. Teak is the most dominant species of this forest. Bamboos, sal, shisham, sandalwood, khair, kusum, arjun and mulberry are other commercially important species.
Dry deciduous: These are found in areas having rainfall between 100 cm and 70 cm. There are open stretches in which teak, sal, peepal and neem grow.
The Thorn Forests and Scrubs
The natural vegetation consists of thorny trees and bushes. This type of vegetation is found in the north-western part of the country, including semi-arid areas of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.

Trees are scattered and have long roots penetrating deep into the soil to get moisture.
The stems are moist to conserve water.
Leaves are mostly thick and small to minimise evaporation.
Acacias, palms, euphorbias and cacti are the main plant species.
Common animals are rats, mice, rabbits, foxes, wolves, tigers, lions, wild donkeys, horses and camels.
Montane Forests
Montane forests are forests which are found in the mountains.

The wet temperate type of forests is found between a height of 1000 and 2000 metres.
At high altitudes, generally more than 3,600 metres above sea level, temperate forests and grasslands give way to the Alpine vegetation.
Alpine grasslands are used for grazing.
At higher altitudes, mosses and lichens form part of tundra vegetation.
The common animals found are Kashmir stag, spotted deer, wild sheep, jackrabbit, Tibetan antelope, yak, snow leopard, squirrels, shaggy horn wild ibex, bear and rare red panda, sheep and goats.
Mangrove Forests
Mangroves are trees that live along tropical coastlines, rooted in salty sediments, often underwater.

The mangrove tidal forests are found in the areas of coasts influenced by tides. Mud and silt get accumulate on such coasts.
Dense mangroves are the common varieties with roots of the plants submerged underwater.
Sundari trees are found in the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta and provide hard timber.
Royal Bengal Tiger is a famous animal in these forests.
Wildlife
India is rich in its fauna.

Elephants are found in the hot wet forests of Assam, Karnataka and Kerala.
One-horned rhinoceroses are found in Assam and West Bengal.
Rann of Kachchh is the habitat for wild donkeys, whereas the Thar Desert is the habitat for camels.
The natural habitat of the Indian lion is the Gir forest in Gujarat.
Tigers are found in the forests of Madhya Pradesh, the Sundarbans of West Bengal and the Himalayan region.
Ladakh’s freezing high altitudes are home to yak, the shaggy horned wild ox, the Tibetan antelope, the bharal (blue sheep), wild sheep, and the kiang (Tibetan wild donkey).
In the rivers, lakes and coastal areas, turtles, crocodiles and gharials are found.
Peacocks, pheasants, ducks, parakeets, cranes and pigeons are some of the birds inhabiting the forests and wetlands of the country.
Cause of Major Threat to Flora and Fauna
Every species has an important role in the ecosystem. Hence, conservation of flora and fauna is essential. About 1,300 plant species are endangered and 20 species are extinct. The main causes of this major threat to nature are:

Hunting for commercial purposes
Pollution due to chemical and industrial waste
Rapidly cutting of the forests for cultivation and habitation
Government Initiative to Protect Flora and Fauna
The government has taken many steps to protect flora and fauna of our country.

18 biosphere reserves have been set up in India to protect flora and fauna. 10 out of these have been included in the world network of biosphere reserves.
Financial and technical assistance has been provided to many botanical gardens by the government since 1992.
Project Tiger, Project Rhino, Project Great Indian Bustard and many other eco-developmental projects have been introduced by the government.
103 National Parks, 535 Wildlife Sanctuaries and Zoological gardens are set up to take care of natural heritage.

POPULATION

Population Size and Distribution
India’s Population Size and Distribution by Numbers
As of March 2011, India’s population was 1,210.6 million, which accounts for 17.5% of the world’s population.
Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state of India, as it counts about 16% of the country’s population.
Almost half of India’s population lives in just five states which are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.
India’s Population Distribution by Density
Population Density is calculated as the number of persons per unit area. The population density of India in the year 2011 was 382 persons per sq km. That’s why India is considered one of the most densely populated countries in the world.

Population Growth and Processes of Population Change
The numbers, distribution and composition of the population are constantly changing. This is the influence of the interaction of the three processes:

Birth
Death
Migration
Population Growth
Growth of population refers to the change in the number of inhabitants of a country/territory during a specific period of time. This change can be expressed in 2 ways:

In terms of absolute numbers: The absolute numbers are obtained by subtracting the earlier population (e.g. that of 2001) from the later population (e.g. that of 2011).
In terms of percentage change per year: It is studied in percent per annum, e.g. a rate of increase of 2 per cent per annum means that in a given year, there was an increase of two persons for every 100 persons in the base population. This is referred to as the annual growth rate.
Processes of Population Change/Growth
Three main processes of change of population are:

1) Birth rates: The birth rate is the number of live births per thousand persons in a year. In India, birth rates have always been higher than death rates.

2) Death rates: The death rate is the number of deaths per thousand persons in a year.

3) Migration: Migration is the movement of people across regions and territories. Migration can be internal (within the country) or international (between the countries). It influences the distribution of the population within the nation. In India, rural-urban migration has resulted in a steady increase in the percentage of the population in cities and towns.

Age Composition
The age composition of a population refers to the number of people in different age groups in a country. The population of a nation is grouped into 3 broad categories:

1) Children (generally below 15 years): They are economically unproductive and need to be provided with food, clothing, education and medical care.

2) Working Age (15–59 years): They are economically productive and biologically reproductive. They comprise the working population.

3) Aged (Above 59 years): They may be working voluntarily, but they are not available for employment through recruitment.

Sex Ratio
It is defined as the number of females per 1000 males in the population. Sex Ratio is an important social indicator to measure the extent of equality between males and females in a society at a given time.

Literacy Rates
According to the Census 2011, a person aged 7 years and above, who can read and write with understanding in any language, is treated as literate. India’s literacy rate is 73%, as per the census of 2011.

Occupational Structure
The distribution of the population according to different types of occupation is referred to as the occupational structure. Occupations are classified as:

Primary: Primary activities include agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, fishing, mining and quarrying, etc
Secondary: Secondary activities include the manufacturing industry, building and construction work, etc.
Tertiary: Tertiary activities include transport, communications, commerce, administration and other services.
Health
Health is an important component of population composition, which affects the process of development. The substantial improvement in Public Health in our country is the result of many factors, such as:

Prevention of infectious diseases
Application of modern medical practices in the diagnosis and treatment of ailments
Adolescent Population
Adolescents are grouped in the age group of 10 to 19 years. They are the most important resource for the future. It constitutes one-fifth of the total population of India. The nutrition requirements of adolescents are higher than those of a normal child or adult.

National Population Policy
The National Population Policy (NPP) 2000 provides a policy framework for imparting free and compulsory school education up to 14 years of age. It also helps in

reducing infant mortality rate to below 30 per 1000 live births
Achieving universal immunisation of children against all vaccine-preventable diseases
Promoting delayed marriage for girls and making family welfare a people-centred programme
NPP 2000 also put emphasis on other important needs of adolescents, including protection from unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It aims to encourage:

Delayed marriage and child-bearing
Education of adolescents about the risks of unprotected sex
Making contraceptive services accessible and affordable
Providing food supplements
Nutritional services
Strengthening legal measures to prevent child marriage


POLITICAL SCIENCE

WHAT IS DEMOCRACY

What Is Democracy? Why Democracy?
Definition of Democracy

Democracy is a form of government in which the rulers are elected by the people. One chief factor common to all democracies is that the government is chosen by the people. It also helps students to demarcate between democratic and non-democratic governments. For the non-democratic government, take the example of Myanmar, where rulers were not elected by the people. Those who were in charge of the country’s army took over as rulers, and people had no say in this decision. Dictators like Pinochet (Chile) are not elected by the people. This also applies to monarchies.

Features of Democracy

The simple definition of democracy gives rise to various questions, which are given below:

Who are the rulers in this definition?
What kind of election constitutes a democratic election?
Who are the people who can elect the rulers or get elected as rulers?
Finally, what form of government is a democracy?
Major Decisions by Elected Leaders

Some countries like Pakistan do not follow this rule. In Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf led a military coup in October 1999. He overthrew the democratically elected government and went on to become the President of the country. In 2002, he also held a referendum in the country that granted him a five-year extension. Meanwhile, after the passing of this ‘Legal Framework Order’, elections were held in the national and provincial assemblies, and elected representatives were granted some powers. But the final power rested with military officers and General Musharraf himself. Hence, we can conclude it was not a democratic country. The same thing happens in many dictatorships and monarchies. Thus, we can conclude that in a democracy, the final decision-making power must rest with those elected by the people.

Free and Fair Electoral Competition

In China, elections are held after every five years to elect the country’s parliament, called Quanguo Renmin Daibiao Dahui (National People’s Congress). Before contesting elections, a candidate needs the approval of the Chinese Communist Party. The government is always formed by the Communist Party. Alternatively, since its independence in 1930, Mexico has held elections after every six years to elect its President. But until 2000, every election was won by a party called PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party). Should we consider the elections described above as examples of people electing their rulers? Reading these examples, we get a sense that we cannot. Democracy must be based on a free and fair election where those currently in power have a fair chance of losing.

One Person, One Vote, One Value 

Democracy is based on a fundamental principle of political equality. However, there are many instances of denial of the equal right to vote. Until 2015, in Saudi Arabia, women did not have the right to vote. Estonia has made its citizenship rules in such a way that people belonging to the Russian minority found it difficult to get the right to vote. In Fiji, the electoral system is such that the vote of an indigenous Fiji has more value than that of an Indian-Fijian. Definitely not a democratic government. The feature of democracy this highlights is that in a democracy, each adult citizen must have one vote, and in turn, each vote must have one value.

Rule of Law and Respect for Rights

Zimbabwe attained independence from White minority rule in 1980, and since then, the country has been ruled by the party that led the freedom struggle, ZANU-PF. Its leader,

Robert Mugabe has ruled the country since independence. Even if elections were held regularly, it was always won by ZANU-PF. President Mugabe was popular but also used unfair practices in elections. There was a law that limited the right to criticise the President. Television and radio were controlled by the government and gave only the ruling party’s version. There were independent newspapers, but the government harassed those journalists who went against it and so on. Not a democratic government. Democratic government rules within limits set by constitutional law and citizens’ rights.

Hence, we can deduce that democracy is a form of government in which:

Rulers elected by the people take all the major decisions
Elections offer a choice and fair opportunity to the people to change the current rulers
This choice and opportunity is available to all people on an equal basis
The exercise of this choice leads to a government limited by basic rules of the constitution and citizens’ rights
Why Democracy?

Cons of Democracy

Leaders keep changing in a democracy leading to instability.
Democracy is all about political competition and power play, leaving no scope for morality.
Many people have to be consulted in a democracy, which leads to delays.
Elected leaders do not know the best interest of the people, resulting in bad decisions.
Democracy leads to corruption since it is based on electoral competition.
Ordinary people don’t know what is good for them; they should not decide anything.
From these arguments, we can see that democracy of the kind we see may not be the ideal form of government. However, we will see if democracy is better than other forms of government that are there for us to choose from.

Arguments in Favour of Democracy

A democratic government is a better government because it is a more accountable form of government: Take the example of the famines of 1958-1961 in India and China. While China was hit badly, India did not fare as badly, despite its economic condition. The reason for this could be that India responded to the food scarcity in a way that the Chinese government did not. Here, we see that democracy is better than any other form of government in responding to the needs of the people.

Democracy improves the quality of decision-making: Democracy is based on consultation and discussion. A democratic decision always involves many people, discussions and meetings, and they are able to point out possible mistakes in any decision. This may take time. However, the advantage of taking time over important decisions is that it reduces the chances of rash or irresponsible decisions.

Democracy provides a method to deal with differences and conflicts: In any society, people are bound to have differences of opinions and interests. These differences are particularly more in a country like ours, with amazing social diversity. People belong to different regions, speak different languages, practise different religions and have different castes. The preferences of one group can clash with those of other groups. How do we resolve such a conflict? Democracy provides the only peaceful solution to this problem. In a democracy, no one is a permanent winner or loser. Different groups can live with one another peacefully.

Democracy enhances the dignity of citizens: Democracy is based on the principle of political equality. It recognises that the poorest and the least educated have the same status as the rich and the educated.

Democracy is better than other forms of government because it allows us to correct our own mistakes: Even if no government can guarantee that no mistakes will be made, in a democracy, one can be sure that it will not be hidden for too long. It makes space for public discussion on these mistakes. There is also room for correction. Rulers have to change their decisions, or they could themselves be changed.

Thus, we can correctly infer that while democracy may not be the solution to all problems, it is still clearly better than any other alternative.

Broader Meanings of Democracy

In this chapter, the meaning of democracy is discussed in a descriptive sense. Students get to learn about democracy as a form of government, thus helping them to identify a clear set of minimal features that democracy requires. The common form adopted by democracy is representative democracy. In democratic countries, all people do not rule. A majority is allowed to take decisions on behalf of all the people through their elected representatives. This has become necessary for the reasons given below:

Modern democracies involve such a large number of people that it is physically impossible for them to sit together and take a collective decision.
Even if they could, the citizen does not have the time, the desire or the skills to take part in all the decisions.
Democracy, as a principle, can go beyond the government and can be applied to any sphere of life. People use the word democracy not to describe any existing government but to set up an ideal standard that all democracies must aim to become. However, if the ideals of democracy are considered, then no country in the world is correctly democratic. Still, having an understanding of democracy as an ideal will explain why to value democracy. It enables people to judge an existing democracy and identify its weaknesses. It also helps to distinguish between a minimal democracy and a good democracy. The most common form of democracy in today’s world is being ruled by people’s elected representatives. However, for a small community, there can be other ways of making democratic decisions. All people can sit together and make decisions directly. This is how the Gram Sabha should work in a village.

CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGNS

Constitutional Design
Democratic Constitution in South Africa

Apartheid

Apartheid is a system of racial discrimination unique to South Africa imposed by white Europeans. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the trading companies from Europe occupied it with arms and force and became the local rulers. The system of apartheid divided the people and labelled them on the basis of their skin colour. The white rulers treated all nonwhites as inferiors. The non-whites did not have voting rights and were forbidden from living in white areas. The blacks, coloured and Indians fought against the apartheid system from 1950. The African National Congress (ANC) was the umbrella organisation that led the struggle against the policies of segregation. Nelson Mandela was one of the leaders amongst the eight who were tried for treason by the white South African government. They were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for daring to oppose the apartheid regime in the country.

Giving Rise to a New Constitution

As the protests and struggles against apartheid increased, the blacks could no longer be kept under the rule of the government through repression. The white regime changed its policies. Discriminatory laws were repealed. Ban on political parties and restrictions on the media were lifted. Nelson Mandela was released after 28 years in the Robben Island Prison. The apartheid government came to an end on midnight of 26 April 1994, paving the way for the formation of a multi-racial government.

Following the emergence of the new democratic South Africa, the party that ruled through oppression and brutal killings and the party that led the freedom struggle sat together to draw up a common constitution. This constitution gave its citizens the most extensive rights available in any country. Together, they decided that in the search for a solution to the problems, nobody should be excluded.

Why the Need for a Constitution?

Take the example of South Africa to see why we need the Constitution and what the constitutions do. The oppressor and oppressed were planning to live together as equals in the new democracy. Each section wanted to safeguard its interests and wanted substantial social and economic rights. Through negotiations, both parties came to a compromise. The whites agreed to the principle of majority rule and that of one person, one vote. They also agreed to accept some basic rights for the poor and the workers. The blacks agreed that majority rule would not be absolute and that the majority would not take away the property of the white minority. How was this compromise to be implemented? The only way to build and maintain trust in such a situation was to write down some rules of the game that everyone would abide by. These supreme rules that no government would be able to ignore are called a constitution.

Every country has diverse groups of people. All over the world, people have differences of opinion and interests. The constitution is the supreme law that determines the relationship among people living in a territory (called citizens) and also the relationship between the people and the government. Find what constitutions do below:

First, it generates a degree of trust and coordination that is necessary for different kinds of people to live together.
Second, it specifies how the government will be constituted and who will have the power to take which decisions.
Third, it lays down limits on the powers of the government and tells us what the rights of the citizens are.
Fourth, it expresses the aspirations of the people about creating a good society.
All countries that have constitutions are not necessarily democratic. But all countries that are democratic will have constitutions.

Making of the Indian Constitution

India’s Constitution was drawn up under very difficult circumstances. The country was born through a partition on the basis of religious differences, and it was a traumatic experience for the people of India and Pakistan. The British had left it to the rulers of the princely states to decide whether they wanted to merge with India or with Pakistan or remain independent. The merger of these princely states was a difficult and uncertain task. When the Constitution was written, the future of the country did not look as secure as it does today.

The Path to the Constitution

One of the major advantages for the makers of the Indian Constitution was that consensus about what a democratic India should look like had already evolved during the freedom struggle. In 1928, Motilal Nehru and eight other Congress leaders drafted a constitution for India, and In 1931, the resolution at the Karachi session of the Indian National Congress dwelt on how independent India’s Constitution should look. Both these documents included features such as Universal Adult Franchise, the Right to Freedom and Equality, and to protect the rights of minorities in the constitution of independent India. These basic values were accepted by all leaders much before the Constituent Assembly met to deliberate on the Constitution. That is why the Indian constitution adopted many institutional details and procedures from colonial laws like the Government of India Act 1935. Many of our leaders were inspired by the ideals of the French Revolution, the practice of parliamentary democracy in Britain and the Bill of Rights in the US.

The Constituent Assembly

The drafting of the constitution was done by an assembly of elected representatives called the Constituent Assembly. Elections to the Constituent Assembly were held in July 1946, and its first meeting was held in December 1946. Soon after, the country was divided into India and Pakistan and the Constituent Assembly was also divided into the Constituent Assembly of India and of Pakistan. The Constituent Assembly that wrote the Indian constitution had 299 members. The Assembly adopted the Constitution on 26 November 1949, but it came into effect on 26 January 1950. To mark this day, we celebrate January 26 as Republic Day every year.

Why should we accept the Constitution made by this Assembly more than six decades ago?

The Constitution does not reflect the views of its members alone. It expresses a broad consensus of its time.
The second reason for accepting the Constitution is that the Constituent Assembly represented the people of India.
Finally, the manner in which the Constituent Assembly worked gives sanctity to the Constitution. The Constituent Assembly worked in a systematic, open and consensual manner.
First, some basic principles were decided and agreed upon. Then a Drafting Committee chaired by Dr B.R. Ambedkar prepared a draft constitution for discussion. Several rounds of thorough discussion took place on the Draft Constitution, clause by clause. More than two thousand amendments were considered. Every document was presented, and every word spoken in the Constituent Assembly has been recorded and preserved. These are called ‘Constituent Assembly Debates.’

Guiding Values of the Indian Constitution

First, understand the overall philosophy of what our Constitution is all about. Read the views of some of our major leaders on our Constitution and read what the Constitution says about its own philosophy. This is what the preamble to the Constitution does.

The Dream and the Promise

There were many members who followed the vision of Mahatma Gandhi. This dream of an India that has eliminated inequality was shared by Dr Ambedkar, who played a key role in the making of the Constitution, but his vision of removing inequalities from India was different from Gandhiji’s.

Philosophy of the Constitution

Values that inspired and guided the freedom struggle and were, in turn, nurtured by it formed the foundation for India’s democracy. Given below are the values embedded in the Preamble of the Indian Constitution.
We, the People of India: The Constitution has been drawn up and enacted by the people through their representatives and not handed down to them by a king or any outside powers.

Sovereign: People have the supreme right to make decisions on internal as well as external matters. No external power can dictate the Government of India.

Socialist: Wealth is generated socially and should be shared equally by society. The government should regulate the ownership of land and industry to reduce socioeconomic inequalities.

Secular: Citizens have complete freedom to follow any religion. But there is no official religion. The government treats all religious beliefs and practices with equal respect.

Democratic: A form of government where people enjoy equal political rights, elect their rulers and hold them accountable. The government is run according to some basic rules.

Republic: The head of the state is an elected person and not a hereditary position.

Justice: Citizens cannot be discriminated against on the grounds of caste, religion and gender. Social inequalities have to be reduced. The government should work for the welfare of all, especially the disadvantaged groups.

Liberty: There are no unreasonable restrictions on the citizens in what they think, how they wish to express their thoughts and the way they wish to follow up their thoughts in action.

Equality: All are equal before the law. The traditional social inequalities have to be ended. The government should ensure equal opportunity for all.

Fraternity: All of us should behave as if we are members of the same family. No one should treat a fellow citizen as inferior.

Institutional Design

A Constitution is not merely a statement of values and philosophy. It is mainly about embodying these values into institutional arrangements. It is a very long and detailed document. Therefore, it needs to be amended quite regularly to keep it updated. Provisions are made to incorporate changes, known as constitutional amendments, from time to time. Like any Constitution, the Indian Constitution also lays down a procedure for choosing persons to govern the country. It defines who will have how much power to make which decisions. And it puts limits to what the government can do by providing some rights to the citizen that cannot be violated.

ELECTORAL POLICIES

Why Do We Need Elections?
Elections take place regularly in any democracy. There are more than 100 countries in the world in which elections take place to choose people’s representatives. The mechanism by which people can choose their representatives at regular intervals and change them is called an election.

In an election, the voters make many choices:

They can choose who will make laws for them.
They can choose who will form the government and take major decisions.
They can choose the party whose policies will guide the government and law-making.
What Makes an Election Democratic?
The minimum conditions of a democratic election include the following points.

Everyone should be able to choose their own representative.
Parties and candidates should be free to contest elections and should offer some real choice to the voters.
Elections must be held regularly after every few years.
The candidate preferred by the people should get elected.
Elections should be conducted in a free and fair manner where people can choose as they really wish.
Is It Good to Have Political Competition?
Elections are all about political competition. This competition takes various forms. At the constituency level, it takes the form of competition among several candidates. Here are a few reasons that support political competition as being good for people.

Regular electoral competition provides incentives to political parties and leaders.
Political parties know that if they raise issues that people want to be raised, their popularity and chances of victory will increase in the next elections. On the contrary, if they fail to satisfy the voters with their work, they will not be able to win again.
If a political party is motivated only by the desire to be in power, despite that, it will be forced to serve the people.
What Is Our System of Election?
Elections are held in India in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha (Assembly) regularly after every five years. After five years, the term of all the elected representatives comes to an end.

Elections held in all constituencies at the same time, either on the same day or within a few days, are called General Elections. Sometimes elections are held only for one constituency to fill the vacancy caused by the death or resignation of a member. This is called a By-Election.

Electoral Constituency
India is divided into different areas for the purpose of elections. These areas are called electoral constituencies. The voters living in an area elect one representative.

For the Lok Sabha elections, India is divided into 543 constituencies. The representative elected from each constituency is called a Member of Parliament or an MP.
Each state is divided into a specific number of Assembly constituencies. In this case, the elected representative is called the Member of the Legislative Assembly or an MLA. Each Parliamentary constituency has within it several assembly constituencies.
The same principle applies to Panchayat and Municipal elections. Each village or town is divided into several ‘wards’ that are like constituencies. Each ward elects one member of the village or the urban local body. Sometimes these constituencies are counted as ‘seats’, for each constituency represents one seat in the assembly.

Reserved Constituencies
Some constituencies are reserved for people who belong to the Scheduled Castes [SC] and Scheduled Tribes [ST]. In the Lok Sabha, 84 seats are reserved for the SC and 47 for the ST.

In SC reserved constituency, only someone who belongs to the Scheduled Caste can stand for election.
Only those belonging to the Scheduled Tribes can contest an election from a constituency reserved for ST.
In many states, seats in rural (panchayat) and urban (municipalities and corporations) local bodies are now reserved for Other Backward Classes (OBC) and women candidates as well.

Voters’ List
In a democratic election, the list of those who are eligible to vote is prepared much before the election and given to everyone, which is officially called the Electoral Roll and is commonly known as the Voters’ List. It is the responsibility of the government to get the names of all the eligible voters put on the voters’ list.

The voters are required to carry Election Photo Identity Card [EPIC] when they go out to vote so that no one can vote for someone else. But the card is not yet compulsory for voting as voters can show many other proofs of identity, like the ration card or the driving licence.

Nomination of Candidates
Anyone who can be a voter can also become a candidate in elections. The candidate should be a minimum of 25 years of age. Every person who wishes to contest an election has to fill out a ‘nomination form’ and give some money as a ‘security deposit’. The candidate has to make a legal declaration, giving full details of:

Serious criminal cases pending against the candidate,
Details of the assets and liabilities of the candidate and his or her family, and
Educational qualifications of the candidate.
This information is made available to the public so that voters can make their decision on the basis of the information provided by the candidates.

Election Campaign
The election campaigns are conducted to have a free and open discussion about who is a better Representative and, in turn, which party will make a better government. In India, Election Campaigns take place for a two-week period between the announcement of the final list of candidates and the date of polling. During this period, the candidates contact their voters, political leaders address election meetings and political parties mobilise their supporters.

Some of the successful slogans given by different political parties in various elections:

Save Democracy
Land to the Tiller
Protect the Self-Respect of the Telugus
According to India’s Election Law, no party or candidate can:

Bribe or threaten voters.
Appeal to them in the name of caste or religion.
Use government resources for election campaigns.
Spend more than 25 lahks in a constituency for a Lok Sabha election or more than 10 lahks in a constituency in an Assembly election.
If any political party does so, their election can be rejected by the court. In addition to the laws, all the political parties in our country have agreed to a Model Code of Conduct for election campaigns. According to this, no party or candidate can:

Use any place of worship for election propaganda.
Use government vehicles, aircraft and officials for election.
Once elections are announced, ministers shall not lay the foundation stones for any projects, take any big policy decisions or make any promises of providing public facilities.
Polling and Counting of Votes
The day when the voters cast or ‘poll’ their vote is called election day. The voting is done in the following manner.

Every person whose name is on the voters’ list can go to a nearby polling booth.
Once the voter goes inside the booth, the election officials identify her, put a mark on her finger and allow her to cast her vote.
An agent of each candidate is allowed to sit inside the polling booth and ensure that the voting takes place in a fair way.
A ballot paper is a sheet of paper on which the names of the contesting candidates, along with party names and symbols, are listed. The ballot paper was used earlier. Nowadays, electronic voting machines (EVM) are used to record votes.

The machine shows the names of the candidates and the party symbols.
The voter has to just press the button against the name of the candidate she wants to give her vote to.
Once the polling is over, all the EVMs are sealed and taken to a secure place.
A few days later, all the EVMs are opened, and the votes secured by each candidate are counted.
The candidate who secures the highest number of votes from a constituency is declared elected.
What Makes Election in India Democratic?
1) Independent Election Commission
In India, elections are conducted by the Election Commission (EC). The Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) is appointed by the President of India. Election Commission is independent and has a wide range of powers which are:

EC takes decisions on every aspect of conduct and control of elections, from the announcement of elections to the declaration of results.
It implements the Code of Conduct and punishes any candidate or party that violates it.
During the election period, the EC can order the government to follow some guidelines, to prevent the use and misuse of governmental power to enhance its chances of winning elections or to transfer some government officials.
When on election duty, government officers work under the control of the EC and not the government.
2) Popular Participation
The quality of the election process can also be checked by seeing the participation of people. People’s participation in the election is measured by voter turnout figures. Turnout indicates the per cent of eligible voters who actually cast their vote.

In India, the poor, illiterate and underprivileged people vote in larger proportion as compared to the rich and privileged sections.
Common people in India feel that through elections, they can bring pressure on political parties to adopt policies and programmes favourable to them.
The interest of voters in election-related activities has been increasing over the years.
3) Acceptance of Election Outcome
One final test of the freedom and fairness of the election is the outcome of the election.

The ruling parties routinely lose elections in India both at the national and state level.
In the US, an incumbent or ‘sitting’ elected representative rarely loses an election. In India, about half of the sitting MPs or MLAs lose elections.
Candidates who are known to have spent a lot of money on ‘buying votes’ and those with known criminal connections often lose elections.
Barring very few disputed elections, the electoral outcomes are usually accepted as ‘people’s verdicts’ by the defeated party.
Challenges to Free and Fair Elections
Elections in India are essentially free and fair. Sometimes this may not be true for every constituency. There are many limitations and challenges to Indian elections. These include:

Candidates and parties with a lot of money enjoy a big and unfair advantage over smaller parties.
Candidates with criminal connections have been able to push others out of the electoral race and to secure a ‘ticket’ from major parties.
Tickets are distributed to relatives from their families.
Elections offer little choice to ordinary citizens as major parties are quite similar to each other, both in policies and practice.
Smaller parties and independent candidates suffer a huge disadvantage compared to bigger parties.

WORKING OF INSTITUTIONS

How Is a Major Policy Decision Taken?
A Government Order
On August 13, 1990, the Government of India issued an order which was called an Office Memorandum. The order says that other than SC and ST, the 27% job reservation benefit will be given to a new third category called Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC). Only persons who belong to backward classes were eligible for this quota.

The Decision Makers
Who decided to issue the Memorandum? Such a major decision would have involved other major functionaries in India, which involves the following points:

The President is the head of the state and is the highest formal authority in India.
The Prime Minister is the head of the government and takes most of the decisions in the Cabinet meetings.
Parliament consists of the President and two Houses, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The Prime Minister must have the support of a majority of Lok Sabha members to pass a memorandum.
When the Office Memorandum was passed in India, it was a hot debate issue. Some felt that this was unfair as it would deny equality of opportunity to those who did not belong to backward communities. At the same time, others felt that this would give a fair opportunity to those communities which so far had not adequately been represented in government employment. This dispute was finally resolved by the Supreme Court of India by hearing all the cases. This case was known as the ‘Indira Sawhney and Others Vs Union of India case’. The Supreme Court judges in 1992 declared that this order of the Government of India was valid. Thus, the dispute came to an end, and this policy has been followed since then.

Need for Political Institutions
Several arrangements are made in modern democracies, which are called Institutions. Democracy works well when these institutions perform functions assigned to them.

Institutions involve meetings, committees and routines. This often leads to delays and complications.
Some of the delays and complications introduced by institutions are very useful as they provide an opportunity for a wider set of people to be consulted.
Institutions make it difficult to have a good decision taken very quickly, but they also make it equally difficult to rush through a bad decision.
Parliament
Decisions are not directly taken in Parliament, but parliamentary discussions on the report influence and shape the decision of the government. These discussions bring pressure on the government to act. If Parliament is not in favour of the decision, then the Government cannot go ahead and cannot implement the decision.
Why Do We Need the Parliament?
An assembly of elected representatives is called Parliament, which exercises supreme political authority on behalf of the people. At the state level, this is called the Legislature or Legislative Assembly. The name may vary in different countries, but such an assembly exists in every democracy.

Parliament exercises political authority on behalf of the people in many ways, as listed below:

The Parliament is the final authority for making laws in any country.
Those who run the government can take decisions only when they get the support of the Parliament.
Parliaments control all the money that governments have.
The Parliament is the highest forum of discussion and debate on public issues and national policy in any country.
Two Houses of Parliament
Most large countries divide the role and powers of Parliament into two parts which are called Chambers or Houses.

One house is usually directly elected by the people and exercises real power on behalf of the people.
The second house is usually elected indirectly and performs some special functions. The most common work for the second house is to look after the interests of various states, regions or federal units.
In India, Parliament consists of 2 houses. The two houses are known as:

The Council of States (Rajya Sabha)
The House of the People (Lok Sabha)
The President of India is a part of the Parliament, although they are not a member of either house. All laws made in the houses come into force only after receiving the assent of the President.

The Indian Constitution does give the Rajya Sabha some special powers over the states. But on most matters, the Lok Sabha exercises supreme power. Here are some points that illustrate this:

Any ordinary law needs to be passed by both the Houses. But if there is a difference between the two Houses, the final decision is taken in a joint session in which members of both houses sit together. The view of the Lok Sabha is likely to prevail in such a meeting since there are a lot many members of the Lok Sabha.
Lok Sabha exercises more powers in money matters.
Lok Sabha controls the Council of Ministers.
Political Executive
At different levels of any government, functionaries take day-to-day decisions but do not exercise supreme power on behalf of the people. All these functionaries are collectively known as the executive. This executive is in charge of the ‘execution’ of the policies of the government. Thus, when we talk about the government, we usually mean the executive.

Political and Permanent Executive
In a democratic country, two categories make up the executive.

One that is elected by the people for a specific period is called the political executive. Political leaders who take big decisions fall into this category.
People who are appointed on a long-term basis are called permanent executives or civil services. People working in civil services are called civil servants. They remain in office even when the ruling party changes. These officers work under the political executive and assist them in carrying out the day-to-day administration.
Why Is the Minister More Powerful than the Civil Servant?

In a democracy, the will of the people is supreme. The minister is an elected representative of the people and thus empowered to exercise the will of the people on their behalf. The minister is finally answerable to the people for all the consequences of his/her decision. That is why the minister takes all the final decisions. The minister is not and is not expected to be an expert in the matters of her ministry. The minister takes the advice of experts on all technical matters and then takes the decision.

Prime Minister and Council of Ministers
There is no direct election to the post of the Prime Minister. The President appoints the Prime Minister.

The President appoints the leader of the majority party, or the coalition of parties that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha, as Prime Minister.
In case no single party or alliance gets a majority, the President appoints the person most likely to secure majority support.
The Prime Minister does not have a fixed tenure. He continues in power so long as he remains the leader of the majority party or coalition.
After the appointment of the Prime Minister, the President appoints other ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister, which are usually from the majority party or the coalition that has the majority in the Lok Sabha.

The Prime Minister is free to choose their ministers as long as they are members of Parliament.
A person who is not a member of Parliament can also become a minister. But such a person has to get elected to one of the Houses of Parliament within six months of appointment as minister.
The Council of Ministers is the official name for the body that includes all the Ministers. It usually has 60 to 80 Ministers of different ranks, as mentioned below:

Cabinet Ministers are usually top-level leaders of the ruling party or parties who are in charge of the major ministries. The cabinet is the inner ring of the Council of Ministers and comprises about 25 ministers.
Ministers of State with independent charge are usually in charge of smaller Ministries. They participate in Cabinet meetings only when specially invited.
Ministers of State are the junior ministers who are assigned to assist cabinet ministers and the ministers of state with independent charge.
Parliamentary democracy in most countries is often known as the Cabinet form of government because most of the decisions are taken in Cabinet meetings. Every ministry has secretaries who are civil servants. The secretaries provide the necessary background information to the ministers to take decisions. The Cabinet as a team is assisted by the Cabinet Secretariat.

Powers of the Prime Minister
As head of the government, the Prime Minister has wide-ranging powers, which are mentioned below:

The Prime Minister chairs Cabinet meetings. He is the head of the government.
He coordinates the work of different departments.
His decisions are final in case disagreements arise between departments.
He exercises general supervision of different ministries.
All ministers work under his leadership.
The Prime Minister distributes and redistributes work to the ministers.
He has the power to dismiss ministers.
When the Prime Minister quits, the entire ministry quits.
The President
The President is the Head of the State. The President supervises the overall functioning of all the political institutions in India, so that they operate in harmony to achieve the objectives of the state.

Election of President
The President is not elected directly by the people. A candidate standing for the President’s post has to get a majority of votes from Members of Parliament (MPs) and the Members of the Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) to win the election.

Powers of President
All governmental activities take place in the name of the President.
All laws and major policy decisions of the government are issued in the name of the President.
All major appointments are made in the name of the President, which includes the appointment of the Chief Justice of India, the Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts of the states, the Governors of the states, the Election Commissioners, Ambassadors to other countries, etc.
All international treaties and agreements are made in the name of the President.
The President is the supreme commander of the defence forces of India.
The President exercises all these powers only on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The President can only appoint the Prime Minister by his/her own will.

The Judiciary
All the courts at different levels in a country put together are called the judiciary. The Indian judiciary consists of the following:

A Supreme Court for the entire nation
High Courts in the states
District Courts
The courts at the local level
India has an integrated judiciary which means the Supreme Court controls the judicial administration in the country. Its decisions are binding on all other courts of the country. It can take up any dispute,

Between citizens of the country,
Between citizens and government,
Between two or more state governments, and
Between governments at the union and state levels.
Independence of the judiciary means that it is not under the control of the legislature or the executive. The judges do not act on the direction of the government or according to the wishes of the party in power.

The judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts are appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister and in consultation with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Once a person is appointed as judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, it is nearly impossible to remove him or her from that position. A judge can be removed only by an impeachment motion passed separately by two-thirds of members of the two Houses of Parliament
Powers of Judiciary
The judiciary in India is one of the most powerful in the world.

The Supreme Court and the High Courts have the power to interpret the Constitution of the country.
They can determine the Constitutional validity of any legislation or action of the executive in the country when it is challenged before them. This is known as the judicial review.
The Supreme Court of India has also ruled that the core or basic principles of the Constitution cannot be changed by the Parliament.
The powers and the independence of the Indian judiciary allow it to act as the guardian of Fundamental Rights. Anyone can approach the courts if the public interest is hurt by the actions of the government. This is called public interest litigation.

DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS

Life without Rights
Let’s take 3 examples which will help you understand what it means to live in the absence of rights.

1) Prison in Guantanamo Bay
The American government picked up about 600 people from all over the world and put them in prison in Guantanamo Bay, allegedly without due process of law. The government said that they were enemies of the US and linked to the attack on New York on 11 September 2001.

2) Citizens’ Rights in Saudi Arabia
In Saudi Arabia, the position of the citizens with regard to their government is as mentioned below:

The country is ruled by a hereditary king, and the people have no role in electing or changing their rulers.
The king selects the legislature as well as the executive.
Citizens cannot form political parties or any political organisations.
There is no freedom of religion.
Women are subjected to many public restrictions.
3) Ethnic Massacre in Kosovo
Yugoslavia was a small province before its split. The population was overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian, but Serbs were the majority in the country. Milosevic, a Serb nationalist, had won the election, and his government was very hostile to the Albanians. He wanted the Serbs to dominate the country. Many Serb leaders thought that Ethnic minorities like Albanians should either leave the country or accept the dominance of the Serbs.

Rights in a Democracy
All of us want to live happily, without fear and without being subjected to bad treatment. For this, we expect others to behave in such a way that does not harm us or hurt us. Equally, our actions should not also harm or hurt others.

A right is possible when you make a claim that is equally possible for others.
A right comes with an obligation to respect others’ rights.
What is recognised by society as rightful becomes the basis of rights. That is why the notion of rights changes from time to time and from society to society.

Any claim can be called a right if it has the following 3 qualities:

The claim should be reasonable.
The claims should be recognised by society.
The claim should be sanctioned by law.
Why Do We Need Rights in a Democracy?
In a democracy, every citizen has the right to vote and the right to be elected to government. Rights play a very special role in a democracy. Rights protect minorities from the oppression of the majority. Rights are guarantees which can be used when things go wrong.

Rights in the Indian Constitution
You already know our Constitution provides for 6 Fundamental Rights. Let’s discuss them one by one.

1) Right to Constitutional Remedies
The Right to Constitutional Remedies empowers citizens to move to a court of law in case of any denial of their fundamental rights.

2) Right to Equality
The Constitution says that the government shall not deny to any person in India equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws. It means that the laws apply in the same manner to all, regardless of a person’s status. This is called the rule of law, which is the foundation of any democracy. It means that no person is above the law. There cannot be any distinction between a political leader, government official and an ordinary citizen.

The government shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.
Every citizen shall have access to public places like shops, restaurants, hotels, and cinema halls.
There shall be no restriction with regard to the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads, playgrounds and places of public resorts maintained by the government or dedicated to the use of the general public.
All citizens have equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment or appointment to any position in the government.
3) Right to Freedom
Under the Indian Constitution, all citizens have the right to:

Freedom of speech and expression
Assemble in a peaceful manner
Form associations and unions
Move freely throughout the country
Reside in any part of the country
Practice any profession or carry on any occupation, trade or business
You cannot exercise your freedom in such a manner that violates others’ right to freedom.

4) Right against Exploitation
Every citizen has a right not to be exploited. The Constitution has clear provisions to prevent the exploitation of the weaker sections of society. The Constitution mentions 3 specific evils as mentioned below and declares them illegal.

The Constitution prohibits ‘traffic in human beings’. Traffic means the selling and buying of human beings, usually women, for immoral purposes.
Our Constitution prohibits forced labour or begar in any form. Begar is a practice where the worker is forced to render service to the ‘master’ free of charge or at a nominal remuneration. When this practice takes place on a life-long basis, it is called the practice of bonded labour.
The Constitution prohibits child labour. Under this, no one can employ a child below the age of 14 to work in any factory or mine or in any other hazardous work, such as railways and ports.
5) Right to Freedom of Religion
Every person has a right to profess, practice and propagate the religion he or she believes in. India is a secular state which means India does not establish any one religion as the official religion. Freedom to practice religion does not mean that a person can do whatever he wants in the name of religion. For example, one cannot sacrifice animals or human beings as offerings to supernatural forces or gods.

6) Cultural and Educational Rights
Indian Constitution specifies the cultural and educational rights of the minorities:

Any section of citizens with a distinct language or culture has a right to conserve it.
Admission to any educational institution maintained by the government or receiving government aid cannot be denied to any citizen on the grounds of religion or language.
All minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.

How Can We Secure These Rights?
Right to Constitutional Remedies makes the other 5 Fundamental Rights effective. When any of our rights are violated, we can seek a remedy through the courts. That is why Dr. Ambedkar called the Right to Constitutional Remedies, ‘the heart and soul’ of our Constitution.

Fundamental Rights are guaranteed against the actions of the Legislatures, the Executive, and any other authorities instituted by the government.
There can be no law or action that violates the Fundamental Rights.
If any act of the Legislature or the Executive takes away or limits any of the Fundamental Rights, it will be invalid.
Expanding Scope of Rights
Fundamental Rights are the source of all rights; our Constitution and law offer a wider range of rights. Over the years, the scope of rights has expanded. From time to time, the courts gave judgments to expand the scope of rights.

Certain rights, like the Right to Freedom of the Press, Right to Information, and Right to Education, are derived from the Fundamental Rights.
Now, school education has become a right for Indian citizens. The governments are responsible for providing free and compulsory education to all children up to the age of 14 years.
Parliament has enacted a law giving the right to information to the citizens.
The Supreme Court has expanded the meaning of the right to life to include the right to food.
The Constitution provides many more rights which may not be Fundamental Rights. For example, the Right to Property is not a Fundamental Right, but it is a constitutional right. The Right to Vote in elections is an important constitutional right.

ECONOMICS

THE STORY OF VILLAGE PALAMPUR

Overview
An introduction to some basic concepts related to production through a hypothetical village called Palampur, where farming is the main activity. The village also has several other activities, such as small-scale manufacturing, dairy, transport, etc., carried out on a limited scale.

Introduction
Palampur is fairly connected with a well-developed system of roads, transport, electricity, irrigation, schools and health centres. The story of Palampur takes us through the different types of production activities in the village. In India, farming is the main production activity across villages.

Organisation of Production
The main aim of production is to produce goods and services, which require four essential components.

Land and other natural resources such as water, forests, minerals
Labour
Physical capital, such as tools, machines, buildings, raw materials and money
A variety of raw materials are required during the process of production, such as the yarn used by the weaver and the clay used by the potter. Money is also essential during production, and both of them in hand is called working capital. The fourth requirement is knowledge and enterprise to be able to put together land, labour and physical capital and produce an output. The factors of production are combining land, labour, physical capital and human capital.

Farming in Palampur
1. Land is fixed
For Palampur, village farming is their main product, and the well-being of these people is related to production on the farms. But, there is a basic constraint in raising farm production. The land area under cultivation is practically fixed.

2. Is there a way one can grow more from the same land?
In the rainy season, Kharif farmers grow jowar and bajra, followed by the cultivation of potatoes between October and December. In winter, farmers grow wheat and a part of the land is devoted to sugarcane, harvested once every year. Due to well-developed irrigation, farmers can grow three different crops. Electricity transformed the system of irrigation. Multiple cropping means to grow more than one crop on a piece of land. Another way for higher yield is modern farming. In the later 1960s, the Green Revolution introduced the Indian farmer to the cultivation of wheat and rice using high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of seeds.

3. Will the land sustain?
Modern farming methods have overused the natural resource base. Due to the increased use of chemical fertilisers, the soil lost its fertility. Natural resources like soil fertility and groundwater are destroyed, and it is very difficult to restore them.

4. How is land distributed between the farmers of Palampur?
The land is important for any kind of farming. In Palampur, about one-third of the 450 families are landless. Dalits have no land for cultivation. 240 families cultivate small plots of land less than 2 hectares in size. In Palampur, there are 60 families of medium and large farmers who cultivate more than 2 hectares of land.

5. Who will provide the labour?
Small farmers cultivate their own lands. Medium and large farmers hire labourers to cultivate their fields who come either from landless families or families cultivating small plots of land. Farm labourers will not have any right over the crops grown on the land. They will be paid wages for their work which can be cash or in-kind, e.g. crop. Sometimes labourers get meals also. Wages vary from region to region, crop to crop, and from one farm activity to another. Farm labourers are employed on a daily basis, or for one particular farm activity like harvesting, or for the whole year.

6. Capital needed in farming
Modern farming methods require a great deal of capital.

1. Most small farmers borrow money from large farmers or village moneylenders or traders who supply various inputs for cultivation. The rate of interest on such loans is very high.

2. The medium and large farmers have their own savings from farming. They are thus able to arrange for the capital needed.

7. Sale of surplus farm products
The wheat the farmers produce from the land is retained in part for their family consumption, and they sell the surplus wheat. Only the medium and large farmers supply wheat to the market.

Non-Farm Activities in Palampur
25 per cent of the people working in Palampur are engaged in activities other than agriculture.

1. Dairy — the other common activity
Other than agriculture, some people are engaged in dairy, and the milk is sold in the nearby village.

2. An example of small-scale manufacturing in Palampur
People are engaged in small-scale manufacturing, which is carried out at home or in the fields. This manufacturing involves very simple production methods.

3. The shopkeepers of Palampur
Traders of Palampur buy various goods from wholesale markets in the cities and sell them in the village. General stores in the village sell a wide range of items like rice, wheat, sugar, tea, oil, biscuits, soap, toothpaste, batteries, candles, notebooks, pens, pencils, and even some types of cloth.

4. Transport: a fast-developing sector
Transport services include rickshaws, tongas, jeeps, tractors, truck drivers, traditional bullock carts and bogeys. They transport people and goods from one place to another and, in return, get paid for it.

PEOPLE AS RESOURCE

Overview
‘People as Resource’ is a way of referring to a country’s working people in terms of their existing productive skills and abilities. Like other resources, the population is also considered as a human resource. When the existing ‘human resource’ is further developed by becoming more educated and healthy, it is called human capital formation. Investment in human capital (through education, training, and medical care) yields a return just like an investment in physical capital.

Human capital is superior to other resources like land and physical capital. Total productivity adds to the growth of the economy. Investment in human resources (via education and medical care) can give high rates of return in future. Countries like Japan have invested in human resources.

Economic Activities by Men and Women
The activities in Economics are divided into three sectors, i.e. primary, secondary and tertiary. The primary sector includes agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishing, poultry farming, mining and quarrying. The secondary sector includes manufacturing. The tertiary sector includes trade, transport, communication, banking, education, health, tourism, services, insurance, etc. These activities are termed economic activities. Economic activities have two parts — market activities and non-market activities. Market activities involve remuneration to anyone who performs, i.e., activity performed for pay or profit. These include the production of goods or services, including government services. Non-market activities are the production for self-consumption. These can be the consumption and processing of primary products and the own-account production of fixed assets.

There was a division of labour between men and women. Men were paid for their services, but to the contrary, women were not paid for their services. Education plays an important role for individuals to make better use of economic opportunities. Most women used to work in places where there was no job security. In this sector, employment was characterised by irregular and low income. Basic facilities were missing, like maternity leave, childcare and other social security systems. However, women with high education and skill formation were paid highly.

Quality of Population
The quality of the population depends upon the literacy rate and health of a person, indicated by life expectancy and skill formation acquired by the people of the country. It ultimately decides the growth rate of the country, and a literate and healthy population is an asset.

Education
Education contributes to the growth of society, enhances the national income and cultural richness and increases the efficiency of governance. Literacy is needed for citizens to perform their duties and enjoy their rights properly. Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, which was introduced in the year 2010, provides elementary education to all children in the age group of 6–14 years. To encourage attendance and retention of children and improve their nutritional status, a mid-day meal scheme was introduced. The 12th plan focused on increasing access, quality, adoption of state-specific curriculum modification, vocationalisation and networking on the use of information technology, distance education, and convergence of formal, non-formal, distance and IT education institutions.

Health
Improvement in the health status of the population has been the priority of the country. The National Policy, too, aimed at improving the accessibility of healthcare, family welfare and nutritional service, especially for the underprivileged segment of the population. India, over the last five decades, has developed its manpower required in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors.

Unemployment
In India, we have unemployment in rural and urban areas, though the nature of unemployment differs in rural and urban areas. In rural areas, unemployment was seasonal and disguised. In urban areas, unemployment was educated unemployment. Seasonal unemployment occurs when people are not able to find jobs during a few particular months of the year. In disguised unemployment, people appeared to be employed. Educated unemployment became a common phenomenon in urban areas. Unemployment leads to the wastage of manpower resources, tends to increase economic overload, and has a detrimental impact on the overall growth of an economy. In India, statistically, the unemployment rate is low.

In the primary sector, the employment structure is characterised by self-employment. Agriculture is the most labour-absorbing sector of the economy. But, in recent years, there has been a decline in the dependence of population on agriculture. Some of the surplus labour in agriculture has moved to either the secondary or the tertiary sector. In the secondary sector, small-scale manufacturing was the most labour-absorbing. In the case of the tertiary sector, various new services are now appearing, like Biotechnology, Information Technology and so on.

POVERTY AS CHALLENGE

Introduction
In our daily life, we see poverty all around us. They could be landless labourers in villages, people living in overcrowded jhuggis in cities, daily wage workers or child workers in dhabas. According to facts, in India, every fourth person is poor.

Two Typical Cases of Poverty
Poverty means hunger and lack of shelter, lack of clean water and sanitation facilities, and lack of a regular job at a minimum decent level. Poverty is considered as one of the biggest challenges of independent India. India would be truly independent only when the poorest of its people become free of human suffering.

Poverty as Seen by  Social Scientists
Social scientists look at poverty through a variety of indicators. Usually, the indicators are used to relate to the levels of income and consumption. But, now, poverty is looked through other social indicators like illiteracy level, lack of general resistance due to malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, lack of job opportunities, lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation, etc.

Poverty Line
The poverty line is a method to measure poverty based on income or consumption levels. Poverty line varies according to time and place. In India, the poverty line is determined through a minimum level of food requirement, clothing, footwear, fuel and light, educational and medical requirement, etc. These physical quantities are multiplied by their prices in rupees. In India, poverty is calculated on the basis of the desired calorie requirement. The accepted average calorie requirement in India is 2400 calories per person per day in rural areas and 2100 calories per person per day in urban areas. On the basis of these calculations, for the year 2011–12, the poverty line for a person was fixed at Rs 816 per month for rural areas and Rs 1000 for urban areas. The poverty line is estimated periodically (normally every five years) by conducting sample surveys carried out by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO).

Poverty Estimates
In India, there is a substantial decline in poverty ratios from about 45 per cent in 1993-94 to 37.2 per cent in 2004–05. The proportion of people below the poverty line further came down to about 22 per cent in 2011–12.

Vulnerable Groups
Social groups vulnerable to poverty are Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe. Similarly, among the economic groups, the most vulnerable groups are the rural agricultural labour households and urban casual labour households. According to a recent study, except for scheduled tribes, all the other three groups (i.e. scheduled castes, rural agricultural labourers and urban casual labour households) have seen a decline in poverty in the 1990s.

Inter-State Disparities
In India, the proportion of poor people is not the same in every state. Bihar and Odisha continued to be the two poorest states, with poverty ratios of 33.7 and 32.6 percent, respectively. Urban poverty is high in Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and West Bengal saw a decline in poverty. Punjab and Haryana have traditionally succeeded in reducing poverty with the help of high agricultural growth rates. Kerala has focused more on human resource development. In West Bengal, land reform measures have helped in reducing poverty. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, public distribution of food grains is responsible for the improvement.

Global Poverty Scenario
In China and Southeast Asian countries, poverty declined substantially as a result of rapid economic growth and massive investments in human resource development. In Sub-Saharan Africa, poverty declined from 51 per cent in 2005 to 41 per cent in 2015. In Latin America, the ratio of poverty has declined from 10 per cent in 2005 to 4 per cent in 2015.

Causes of Poverty
There are various reasons for widespread poverty in India.

1. Under British control, India had a low level of economic development. New policies of the colonial government ruined traditional handicrafts and discouraged the development of industries. like textiles. A low rate of growth and an increase in population combined make the growth rate of per capita income very low. With the spread of irrigation and the Green Revolution, many job opportunities were created in the agriculture sector. However, these were not enough to absorb all the job seekers.

2. Another feature of high poverty rates has been the huge income inequalities. One of the major reasons for this is the unequal distribution of land and other resources. In India, lack of land resources has been one of the major causes of poverty in India, but proper implementation of policy could have improved the lives of millions of rural poor.

3. Small farmers needed money to buy agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, etc. So, they used to borrow money and were unable to repay the loan because of poverty.

Anti-Poverty Measures
The current anti-poverty scheme is divided into two parts.

1 Promotion of economic growth

2 Targeted anti-poverty programmes

Since the eighties, India’s economic growth has been one of the fastest in the world. There is a strong link between economic growth and poverty reduction. Some of the schemes which are formulated to affect poverty directly or indirectly are:

1. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 – It aimed to provide 100 days of wage employment to every household to ensure livelihood security in rural areas. It also aimed at sustainable development to address the cause of drought, deforestation and soil erosion. One-third of the proposed jobs have been reserved for women.

2. In 1993, Prime Minister Rozgar Yojana (PMRY) was started. The main aim of the programme is to create self-employment opportunities for educated unemployed youth in rural areas and small towns.

3. In 1995, Rural Employment Generation Programme (REGP) was launched. The aim of the programme is to create self-employment opportunities in rural areas and small towns.

4. In 1999, Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) was launched. The programme aims at bringing the assisted poor families above the poverty line by organising them into self-help groups through a mix of bank credit and government subsidy.

5. In 2000, the Pradhan Mantri Gramodaya Yojana (PMGY) was launched. Under this programme, additional central assistance is given to states for basic services such as primary health, primary education, rural shelter, rural drinking water and rural electrification.

The Challenges Ahead
In India, Poverty has certainly declined in India, but it still remains India’s most compelling challenge. Poverty reduction is expected to make better progress in the next ten to fifteen years. This can be achieved by higher economic growth, increasing stress on universal free elementary education, declining population growth, and increasing empowerment of women and the economically weaker sections of society.

FOOD SECURITY IN INDIA

Overview
Food security means the availability, accessibility and affordability of food to all people at all times. Food security depends on the Public Distribution System (PDS) and government vigilance and action at times when this security is threatened.

What Is Food Security?
Food security has the following dimensions

(a) Availability of food means food production within the country, food imports and the previous years’ stock stored in government granaries.

(b) Accessibility means food is within reach of every person.

(c) Affordability implies that an individual has enough money to buy sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet one’s dietary needs.

Food security is ensured in a country only if

(1) Enough food is available for all the persons

(2) All persons have the capacity to buy food of acceptable quality

(3) There is no barrier to access to food.

Why Food Security?
During natural calamities, such as drought, the production of food grains decreases, creating a shortage of food in the affected areas. The prices increase due to a shortage of food. People cannot afford to buy food, and if such a calamity happens in a very wide spread area or is stretched over a longer time period, it might cause a situation of starvation. Massive starvation might take turn into a famine. A Famine is characterised by widespread deaths due to starvation and epidemics caused by the forced use of contaminated water or decaying food and loss of body resistance due to weakening from starvation.

Who Are Food-Insecure?
In India, a large section of people suffers from food and nutrition insecurity. People having little or no land, traditional artisans, providers of traditional services, petty self-employed workers, and the destitute, including beggars, are the worst affected groups. In the urban areas, food-insecure families are those who are generally employed in ill-paid occupations and the casual labour market. These workers are largely engaged in seasonal activities and are paid very low wages.

The social composition, along with the inability to buy food, also plays a role in food insecurity. People of SC, ST and OBC communities who have either poor land-base or very low land productivity are prone to food insecurity. People affected by natural disasters, who migrate to other areas in search of work, are among the most food-insecure people. A large proportion of pregnant and nursing mothers and children under the age of 5 years constitute an important segment of the food-insecure population.

Another aspect of food insecurity is hunger, which is not just an expression of poverty; it brings about poverty. Hunger has chronic and seasonal dimensions. Chronic hunger is a consequence of diets persistently inadequate in terms of quantity and/or quality. Seasonal hunger is related to cycles of food growing and harvesting.

Since Independence, India has been aiming at self-sufficiency in food grains. After Independence, Indian policymakers adopted all measures to achieve self-sufficiency in food grains. In the field of agriculture, India adopted a new strategy, which resulted in the ‘Green Revolution’.

Food Security in India
Since the Green Revolution, the country has avoided famine even during adverse weather conditions. India has become self-sufficient in food grains during the last 30 years because of a variety of crops grown all over the country. The availability of food grains has been ensured with a carefully designed food security system by the government. This system has two components: (a) buffer stock and (b) public distribution system.

What Is Buffer Stock?
Buffer stock is the stock of food grains, namely wheat and rice, procured by the government through the Food Corporation of India (FCI). The stock of wheat and rice are purchased by the FCI from the farmers where there is surplus production. The farmers are paid a pre-announced price for their crops, called Minimum Support Price (MSP). Every year, the MSP is declared by the government before the sowing season to provide incentives to farmers for raising the production of these crops. Buffer Stock is created to distribute food grains in the deficit areas and among the poorer section of society at a price lower than the market price, also known as Issue Price.

What Is the Public Distribution System?
FCI distributes the food procured from the farmer through government-regulated ration shops. It is called the Public Distribution System (PDS). Ration shops, also known as Fair Price Shops, keep stock of foodgrains, sugar, and kerosene for cooking. Rationing in India was introduced during the 1940s against the backdrop of the Bengal famine. In the mid-1970s, three important food intervention programmes were introduced:

Public Distribution System (PDS) for food grains
Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
Food-for-Work (FFW)
At present, there are several Poverty Alleviation Programmes (PAPs), mostly in rural areas, which have an explicit food component also. Employment programmes greatly contribute to food security by increasing the income of the poor.

Current Status of Public the Distribution System
Public Distribution System (PDS) is the most important step taken by the Government of India towards ensuring food security. In 1992, Revamped Public Distribution System (RPDS) was introduced in the country. From June 1997, Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) was introduced to adopt the principle of targeting the ‘poor in all areas’. In 2000, two special schemes were launched Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Annapurna Scheme (APS).

Over the year, the PDS proved to be the most effective instrument of government policy in stabilising prices and making food available to consumers at affordable prices. However, the Public Distribution System has faced severe criticism on several grounds. A high level of buffer stocks of food grains is very undesirable and wasteful. In states such as Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh, mainly two crops — wheat and rice— are grown. The intensive utilisation of water in the cultivation of rice has also led to environmental degradation and a fall in the water level, threatening the sustainability of agricultural development in these states.

PDS dealers started malpractice like diverting the grains to open market to get better margin, selling poor quality grains at ration shops, irregular opening of the shops, etc. In recent years, there has been another factor that has led to the decline of the PDS. The three types of cards and the range of prices that you see today did not exist. Now, with TPDS of three different prices, any family above the poverty line gets a very little discount at the ration shop. The price for APL families is almost as high as the open market price, so there is little incentive for them to buy these items from the ration shop.

Role of Cooperatives in Food Security
In India, cooperatives also play an important role in food security, especially in the southern and western parts of the country. The cooperative societies set up shops to sell low-priced goods to poor people. Some examples of cooperative societies are Mother Dairy in Delhi, Amul from Gujarat, and the Academy of Development Science (ADS) in Maharashtra.
